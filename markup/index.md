# Document markup

Marking up text documents is an increasingly popular method of encoding information in a way that is both comprehensible to humans, but also machine-processable.  

In their simplest form, markup languages can be used to include processing instructions for text - to indicate how the text should be displayed, for example.  But markup languages can also be used to encode information about the text, making it possible to have a greater understanding of the meaning of the text. 

Because the marked-up documents reside in simple text files, it is relatively easy to open and view them in a text editor.  They are also less likely to become obsolete and unreadable, particularly if the markup language follows a standard.

## Markup languages

There are several commonly used markup languages.  In some cases, the markup languages themselves have been expanded to more specific purposes.  The sections below link to additional information about some common markup systems.

# Markdown

Markdown is increasingly popular as a lightweight way to include formatting in text documents.  It is the markup system used by the popular GitHub repository system.

# XML

XML provides a powerful way to encode complex information in a text document.  It can also be used to impose structure to data.  As a W3C standard, its use is common across the Internet in forms such as XHTML web pages and SVG graphics.  There are also standards for accessing and manipulating XML data, such as XPath, XSLT, and XQuery.

## Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)

TEI is commonly used in the Digital Humanities to mark up text documents for processing and data extraction.  The Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) is a similar system that is used to mark up text that denotes musical scores.

## XSLT

Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) is a language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents.

## XQuery

XQuery is a powerful functional programming language that can operate on XML.  For further information, follow the XQuery links on the [Scripting and Programming Languages page](../script/)

# JSON

JSON is an increasingly popular way to transmit data in a structured way.  It is probably the most common way that data are provided to software and web pages via APIs.
