Docker is a system that allows you to containerize a deployed application along with all of its configuration settings and associated files.  When you deploy a Docker container image, it is ready to run.  If you mess up a container, you can destroy it and redeploy the image. 

Docker Compose is a feature of Docker that allows several containers to interact with each other in a pre-determined way.  It allows one to archive a complex setup of several applications in a way that others can easily deply them.
