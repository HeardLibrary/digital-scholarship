# Wikidata Working Group

A shortened link to this page is [vanderbi.lt/wikidata](http://vanderbi.lt/wikidata)

## About the group

The Wikidata Working Group is working group of the [Digital Scholarship and Communications Office (DiSC)](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/).  This new group is starting up for the first time in the fall of 2019.

As a project this semester, we are going to upload Vanderbilt researcher information and publications to [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) so that it can be visualized using [Scholia](https://tools.wmflabs.org/scholia/).  All sessions are intended to be hands-on, so please bring a laptop.


## Venue and time

The Working Group meets in Vanderbilt's Central Library on Mondays from 1:10 to 2:00 PM.  The first meeting is on the 8th floor in Room 800FA.  All subsequent meetings will be held on the 6th floor in the Vanderbilt Authors Room (418A).
