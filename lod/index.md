# Linked Open Data

Linked Data is a graph-based data representation that enables sharing and linking data among providers. Linked Open Data makes those data freely available.

At Vanderbilt, the [Digital Scholarship and Scholarly Communications Office](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) sponsors a Linked Data Working Group that explores issues related to Linked Data.
