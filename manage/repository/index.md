# Research Data Repositories

## Selecting a Research Data Repository

Selecting the best repository to house a dataset may be straightforward, if there is already a well-established subject based repository in your discipline, or it may take some research to determine the best place for your data.  Look for a research data repository with open licenses, to make your datasets more accessible (CC-0 is the least restrictive license). The repository should provide clear, persistent citations for datasets.  Repositories offer a range of services to depositors (from data validation to peer review) and to users (from in-browser data exploration to visualization and analysis tools), which may also influence your choice.  The [Digital Scholarship and Scholarly Communications Team](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) is happy to assist you as you select an appropriate data repository.

## Finding Research Data Repositories

There are several useful tools for finding data repositories that serve your field.

- The [list of Open Access Data Repositories from Simmons College](http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Data_repositories) is grouped by discipline.
- The [Registry of Research Data Repositories (re3data)](http://www.re3data.org/) is a searchable listing of data repositories worldwide.  Use it to identify data repositories serving your discipline and their policies regarding open access and data citations.

# Important Data Repositories

## Figshare

If you would like to publish a dataset but cannot find an appropriate subject-based repository, you may want to consider using Figshare, "a repository where users can make all of their research outputs available in a citable, shareable and discoverable manner."  The research outputs you can upload to Figshare include datasets, figures, papers, posters, and video.  When you publish research materials on Figshare, they receive a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), providing a persistent citation.  Figshare also supports version control, so that you can update or add to a dataset without confusing other researchers who may wish to cite it.

## Zenodo

If you are using Github to manage a project, you can easily archive dataset releases using Zenodo.  Zenodo assigns a digital object identifier (DOI) to the dataset, making it easier to cite the dataset in publications.
