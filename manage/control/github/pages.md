# Managing a website with GitHub Pages

## The Big Picture

![relationships diagram](../images-pages/big_picture.png)

**Markdown text file** (editing in local repository)

<img src="../images-pages/page_markdown.png" style="border:1px solid black">

**Text file rendered on GitHub** (online repository)

URL pattern `https://github.com/accountname/repository/blob/branch/path`

Example URL <https://github.com/HeardLibrary/digital-scholarship/blob/gh-pages/manage/control/github/projects.md>

<img src="../images-pages/page_github.png" style="border:1px solid black">

**Web page generated by Jekyll from text file** (rendered website)

URL pattern `https://accountname.github.io/repository/path`

Example URL <https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/manage/control/github/projects/>

<img src="../images-pages/page_rendered.png" style="border:1px solid black">

**Note on case sensitivity:**

Internet domains and subdomains are not case sensitive. Notice in the example above, the organizational account name is `HeardLibrary`. However, when that name is used as the subdomain, it can be in any case and still work, as in the URL above in all lower case. Thus, the URL <https://HeardLibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/manage/control/github/projects/> will work, although it gets re-written in all lower case, (i.e. `heardlibrary`).

However, case sensitivity in parts of URLs after the domain name depends on the web server. The GitHub pages server IS case sensitive. So the URL <https://heardlibrary.github.io/Digital-Scholarship/manage/control/github/projects/> (with capitalization in the repository name) will NOT work.

Because the repository name and directory structure will be used to form the eventual URLs of web pages, it is best to use repository and directory names that are:
- short
- all lower case
- alphabetic only (although names with numerals, underscores `_`, and hyphens `-` are allowable)


**Simplifying the URL by dropping the repository name**

As you can see above, the normal URL pattern is for the repository name to immediately follow the subdomain name as the first part of the URL hierarchy. There is a special trick that you can use to eliminate the repository name from the URL and have the path follow immediately after the subdomain name. 

The trick is to name the repository as the eventual subdomain name when the website is rendered. Here is an example. I have a repository named `baskaufs.github.io`: 

<https://github.com/baskaufs/baskaufs.github.io>

If I want to go to the page that has the path [/civil-war/about.htm](https://github.com/baskaufs/baskaufs.github.io/blob/master/civil-war/about.htm) within that repository, I can simply use the URL <https://baskaufs.github.io/civil-war/about.htm>, that is, the subdomain followed directly by the path.

Since you can only have one repository named `account.github.io`, you can drop only drop the repository name for one website in the account.

**What if I have purchased my own domain name?**

If you have purchased your own domain name, then it doesn't matter what your account and repository names are. When you set up the redirect, it will point directly to the website's source directory and the custom domain name will be followed immediately by the path. So you should still try to follow the rules above about directory names to keep the URL simple.

Mapping to a custom domain is an advanced topic and won't be covered in this lesson. However, even if you map your domain name to the website, the default URLs described above will still work. So if you stop paying for the domain name, your website will still work as long as you link to the default URLs.


## Setting up Pages for a GitHub repository

Each repository can have a GitHub Pages website associated with it. We use the settings to determine the directory where that website lives. In this example, we will use the repository name `website`. 

Create a new repository called `website` and initialize it with a README.md file. Don't worry too much about what's in the README since most people will never see it.

Click on the `Settings` tab, then click on `Pages` in the left navigation menu.

### Setting up 

## notes

[using Jekyll with Bundler](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/using-jekyll-with-bundler/) to render Jekyll pages offline.  The command to invoke is

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --incremental
```
