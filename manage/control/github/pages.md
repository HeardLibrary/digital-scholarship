# Managing a website with GitHub Pages

## The Big Picture

![relationships diagram](../images-pages/big_picture.png)

**Markdown text file** (editing in local repository)

<img src="../images-pages/page_markdown.png" style="border:1px solid black">

**Text file rendered on GitHub** (online repository)

URL pattern `https://github.com/account/repository/blob/branch/path`

Example URL <https://github.com/HeardLibrary/digital-scholarship/blob/gh-pages/manage/control/github/projects.md>

<img src="../images-pages/page_github.png" style="border:1px solid black">

**Web page generated by Jekyll from text file** (rendered website)

URL pattern `https://account.github.io/repository/path`

Example URL <https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/manage/control/github/projects/>

<img src="../images-pages/page_rendered.png" style="border:1px solid black">

**Note on case sensitivity:**

Internet domains and subdomains are not case sensitive. Notice in the example above, the organizational account name is `HeardLibrary`. However, when that name is used as the subdomain, it can be in any case and still work, as in the URL above in all lower case. Thus, the URL <https://HeardLibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/manage/control/github/projects/> will work, although it gets re-written in all lower case, (i.e. `heardlibrary`).

However, case sensitivity in parts of URLs after the domain name depends on the web server. The GitHub pages server IS case sensitive. So the URL <https://heardlibrary.github.io/Digital-Scholarship/manage/control/github/projects/> (with capitalization in the repository name) will NOT work.

Because the repository name and directory structure will be used to form the eventual URLs of web pages, it is best to use repository and directory names that are:
- short
- all lower case
- alphabetic only (although names with numerals, underscores `_`, and hyphens `-` are allowable)



## Setting up Pages for a GitHub repository

Each repository can have a GitHub Pages website associated with it. We use the settings to determine the directory where that website lives. In this example

[using Jekyll with Bundler](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/using-jekyll-with-bundler/) to render Jekyll pages offline.  The command to invoke is

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --incremental
```
