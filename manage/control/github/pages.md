# Managing a website with GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a system for creating free, non-commercial websites using GitHub. It's a static site generator, meaning that the content of every page is created manually (vs. dynamic sites where pages are generated from a database or based on user input).

For further reference, read [GitHub's documentation about Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)

## The Big Picture

![relationships diagram](../images-pages/big_picture.png)

**Markdown text file** (editing in local repository)

<img src="../images-pages/page_markdown.png" style="border:1px solid black">

**Text file rendered on GitHub** (online repository)

URL pattern `https://github.com/accountname/repository/blob/branch/path`

Example URL <https://github.com/HeardLibrary/digital-scholarship/blob/gh-pages/manage/control/github/projects.md>

<img src="../images-pages/page_github.png" style="border:1px solid black">

**Web page generated by Jekyll from text file** (rendered website)

URL pattern `https://accountname.github.io/repository/path`

Example URL <https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/manage/control/github/projects/>

<img src="../images-pages/page_rendered.png" style="border:1px solid black">

**Note on case sensitivity:**

Internet domains and subdomains are not case sensitive. Notice in the example above, the organizational account name is `HeardLibrary`. However, when that name is used as the subdomain, it can be in any case and still work, as in the URL above in all lower case. Thus, the URL <https://HeardLibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/manage/control/github/projects/> will work, although it gets re-written in all lower case, (i.e. `heardlibrary`).

However, case sensitivity in parts of URLs after the domain name depends on the web server. The GitHub pages server IS case sensitive. So the URL <https://heardlibrary.github.io/Digital-Scholarship/manage/control/github/projects/> (with capitalization in the repository name) will NOT work.

Because the repository name and directory structure will be used to form the eventual URLs of web pages, it is best to use repository and directory names that are:
- short
- all lower case
- alphabetic only (although names with numerals, underscores `_`, and hyphens `-` are allowable)


**Simplifying the URL by dropping the repository name**

As you can see above, the normal URL pattern is for the repository name to immediately follow the subdomain name as the first part of the URL hierarchy. There is a special trick that you can use to eliminate the repository name from the URL and have the path follow immediately after the subdomain name. 

The trick is to name the repository as the eventual subdomain name when the website is rendered. Here is an example. I have a repository named `baskaufs.github.io`: 

<https://github.com/baskaufs/baskaufs.github.io>

If I want to go to the page within the repo that has the path [/civil-war/about.htm](https://github.com/baskaufs/baskaufs.github.io/blob/master/civil-war/about.htm) within that repository, I can simply use the URL <https://baskaufs.github.io/civil-war/about.htm>, that is, the subdomain name followed directly by the path.

Since you can only have one repository named `account.github.io`, you can drop only drop the repository name for one website in the account.

**What if I have purchased my own domain name?**

If you have purchased your own domain name, then it doesn't matter what your account and repository names are. When you set up the redirect, it will point directly to the website's source directory and the custom domain name will be followed immediately by the path. So you should still try to follow the rules above about directory names to keep the URL simple.

Mapping to a custom domain is an advanced topic and won't be covered in this lesson. However, even if you map your domain name to the website, the default URLs described above will still work. So if you stop paying for the domain name, your website will still work as long as you link to the default URLs.


## Setting up Pages for a GitHub repository

Each repository can have a GitHub Pages website associated with it. We use the settings to determine the directory where that website lives. In this example, we will use the repository name `website`. 

Create a new repository called `website` and initialize it with a README.md file. Don't worry too much about what's in the README since most people will never see it.

<img src="../images-pages/new_repo.png" style="border:1px solid black">

Click on the `Settings` tab, then click on `Pages` in the left navigation menu.

<img src="../images-pages/select_pages.png" style="border:1px solid black">

### Setting up the source of the website

Historically, there have been two typical ways to configure a GitHub Pages website: using the `docs` directory within the `main` branch, or using the root directory of a branch called `gh-pages`. You can use either method, but we recommend using the `docs` directory for a couple reasons. 

One is that it does not require understanding anything about branches and how to switch between them. The other is that it allows you to simultaneously edit the website (within the `docs` directory) and other files in different directories of the default `main` branch. If you use the `gh-pages` branch for the website, you need to commit any changes to files before you switch between the `main` and `gh-pages` branches -- you can't work on files within and outside of the website at the same time. If your repository is only going to be used for a website, then it doesn't matter, but in some cases you might have data files, build scripts, etc. living in other parts of the repository outside of the 'docs' directory and the inability to edit them at the same time as the website can be annoying. 

To use the `docs` directory of the `main` branch, do the following steps:

Drop down the `Select branch` (defaulting to `None`) dropdown and select `main`.

<img src="../images-pages/select_main.png" style="border:1px solid black">

Drop down the `Select folder` (defaulting to `/(root)`) dropdown and select `docs`.

<img src="../images-pages/select_docs.png" style="border:1px solid black">

Then click the `Save` button. If successful, you should see a message saying that your website is ready to be published. For now, we will skip setting up the Theme Chooser and Custom domain. HTTPS is automatically enforced, so the URL will begin with `https://`.

<img src="../images-pages/success.png" style="border:1px solid black">

### Setting up the landing page for the website

We are now ready to create the landing page for the website. In theory, you could do all of the editing using the online editor, but that would be annoying and not make use of the tools available with a good code editor. Making your edits locally and pushing them up to GitHub also lets you control when the changes become visible. You can edit the website using a number of commits and when it's the way you want, you can push them all to GitHub at once.

Clone the new repository to your local drive. If you don't know how to do that, watch [this video](https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/script/codegraf/016/#cloning-a-repository-6m38s) and look at the accompanying screenshots.

Once you've cloned the repo, go to the repository folder and create a subfolder called `docs`. 

<img src="../images-pages/create_docs_folder.png" style="border:1px solid black">

Now open your code editor. We will use Atom since it's easy to use and has a Markdown preview. (To get rid of the `Project` pane at the left, go to the `View` menu and toggle `Toggle Tree View`.) Create a new file with a first level header line (`#` at the left margin), a blank line, and another line with text. Save the file as `index.md` in the `docs` folder you created. To see what the Markdown will look like when it's rendered, select `Markdown preview` and `Toggle preview` from the `Packages` menu.

<img src="../images-pages/minimal_page_preview.png" style="border:1px solid black">

If you look at the GitHub Desktop interface, you'll see the new page you created.

<img src="../images-pages/desktop_index.png" style="border:1px solid black">

If you are using a Mac, you may also see an annoying "invisible" file called `.DS_Store`. We don't really want our website mucked up with this file, so let's add it to a `.gitignore` file for the repository. Using your text editor, create a file in the root directory of the repository called `.gitignore` with a single line like this:

```
.DS_Store
```

<img src="../images-pages/edit_gitignore.png" style="border:1px solid black">

Now if you look at GitHub Desktop again, you'll see the new `.gitignore` file you created, but the `.DS_Store` file is no longer visible since git is ignoring it.

<img src="../images-pages/ds_store_gone.png" style="border:1px solid black">

You can close the .gitignore tab in Atom since you won't need it any more. Write a commit summary, then click `Commit to main`. 

<img src="../images-pages/ds_store_gone.png" style="border:1px solid black">

If you click the `History` tab, you'll see your latest commit added to the history of the local repository. But the `1` by the `Push origin` tab shows that this commit has not yet been pushed to GitHub. 

<img src="../images-pages/ready_to_push.png" style="border:1px solid black">

Click the `Push origin` tab. 

In the GitHub web interface, click the `Code` tab, then the `docs` folder, then the `index.md` file. You should immediately be able to see the rendered landing page Markdown file. 

<img src="../images-pages/rendered_landing_page.png" style="border:1px solid black">

To see the actual web page as converted by Jekyll, type the base URL for the website into your browser, using this form: `https://accountname.github.io/repository/`. In this example, it's `https://baskaufs.github.io/website/`.

<img src="../images-pages/jekyll_landing_page.png" style="border:1px solid black">

If you don't immediately see the web page, wait a minute and try again. Jekyll does not immediately render changes to GitHub pages websites -- sometimes there is a short delay. 

This is a very boring, vanilla website because we didn't select any theme. However, if we right click the page and select `View page source`, we can see that Jekyll did do some "magic" for use. 

<img src="../images-pages/view_page_source.png" style="border:1px solid black">

The web page has been converted from Markdown to HTML for us. In this case, it just created an `<h1>` and a `<p>` element from the Markdown that we wrote in the source document. But it's easy to generate much more complex HTML from simple Markdown.

## Adding content to the web page

Let's add a couple more elements to the page to make it better. If you don't know any Markdown, start by reviewing [some basic markup](https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/script/codegraf/017/#markdown-3m22s). I'm going to add some formatted text and a link to Wikipedia:

```
# A web page about star-nosed moles

*Star nose moles* are one of the coolest creatures on the planet, so who wouldn't want to learn about them?

You can read more about them by going to their [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-nosed_mole).
```

We can see how this Markdown is rendered by looking at the Markdown preview.

<img src="../images-pages/page_with_link.png" style="border:1px solid black">

You can test that the link works by clicking on it in the preview. 

Adding an image is very similar in format to adding a link. The main difference is that it's preceeded by an exclamation mark (`!`). The alt text goes in the square brackets and the direct link to the image goes in the parentheses. 

[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/) is a good place to look for images that can be freely used on your website. I searched for "star-nosed mole" and found a good picture: <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Condylura.jpg>. However, this URL is the URL to the web page about the picture, not the picture itself. To get the actual image URL, click the `Download` link above the picture, then click the link for the size of image you want. 

<img src="../images-pages/commons_image_select.png" style="border:1px solid black">

The image will open in a new tab.

<img src="../images-pages/raw_image_url.png" style="border:1px solid black">

The URL in the browser bar is the one you need to use to embed the image in your page. This image isn't under copyright, but I'll add an attribution link anyway, using the information provided in the popup Download dialog.

Here's what the Markdown looks like for adding the image:

```
## Appearance

Here's what a star-nosed mole looks like:

![front view of a star-nosed mole](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Condylura.jpg)
[US National Parks Service, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Condylura.jpg)

Isn't it adorable?!
```

The Markdown preview will give you a fairly good idea of what the page will look like and at least show you if you got the image URL right.

<img src="../images-pages/final_page_rendered.png" style="border:1px solid black">

Save the edited Markdown, then go to GitHub desktop, add a commit message, commit, and push the changes to GitHub.

After waiting a few moments for Jekyll to re-render the page, go to the landing page tab and refresh the page. If the changes don't show up for a long time, make sure that you actually saved the file in Atom, that the commit with the changes shows up in the commit history, and that there isn't any little `1` in the `Fetch/Push origin` tab. 

<img src="../images-pages/final_jekyll_page.png" style="border:1px solid black">

There is still some room for improvement, but we'll work on that later.

## Subpages

Subpages have URLs that extend via slashes (`/`) beyond the landing page URL.

### Creating child pages

There are two methods for creating other pages below the landing page in the website hierarchy. I'll call them "named Markdown files" and "folder/index.md". 

Your choice of method will depend primarily on your organizational style preferences and on whether you intend to have a complex page hierarchy represented in the site URLs. 

**named Markdown files method**

Let's say that I want to have two child pages of the landing page called `habits` and `folklore`. Using the "named Markdown files" option, I would just create two Markdown files within the `docs` folder called `habits.md` and `folklore.md`. 

<img src="../images-pages/named_markdown.png" style="border:1px solid black">

When rendered by Jekyll, these pages would have the URLs

```
https://baskaufs.github.io/website/habits/
https://baskaufs.github.io/website/folklore/
```

As you can see, the filename in front of `.md` is appended to the landing page URL. 

**folder/index.md method**

The alternate method is to create a subfolder for each child page, called `habits` and `folklore` respectively, and within each of those subfolders, create a Markdown file called `index.md`. 

<img src="../images-pages/folder_index_md.png" style="border:1px solid black">

If you never want to have a structure that's more nested than one level below the landing page, either method is equally good. 

**Deeply nested child pages**

However, if you wanted to have some lower level pages like

```
https://baskaufs.github.io/website/folklore/virginia/
https://baskaufs.github.io/website/folklore/maine/
```

then you would need to create a `folklore` folder with an `index.md` file within it to handle the page `https://baskaufs.github.io/website/folklore/`, then place either named Markdown files for `virginia.md` and `maine.md` within the `folklore` folder, or create `virginia` and `main` subfolders of `folklore` and put an `index.md` file in each of them.

### Linking between parent, child, and sibling pages

When creating linkes between pages on the site, it's best to use relative links. That makes the website more portable. Here's how to set up relative links between child pages, their parent pages, and sibling pages in the same level of the hierarchy. Note: the links are based on the URLs and are independent of the method used to actually create the pages.

**linking to child pages**

In the parentheses for the hyperlink, place the name of the child page, followed by a slash. For example, to link from the landing page to the `folklore` page, use

```
[learn about folklore](folklore/)
```

To link from the `folklore` page to the `virginia` page, use

```
[folk stories from Virginia](virginia/)

**Linking to parent pages**

In the parentheses for the hyperlink, use the relative path for a parent element (`..`) followed by a slash. For example, to link from the folklore page to the landing page, use

```
[back to the landing page](../)
```

The link from the Virginia folklore page up to the general folklore page would be similar.

**Linking to sibling pages**

To link from one page to another page at the same level below the same page, use the parent element path as in the previous example, followed by the name of the sibling page followed by a slash. For example, to link from the `folklore` page to the `habits` page, use

```
[habits of the mole](../habits/)
```

To link from the Virginia folklore to the Maine folklore page, use

```
[folklore from Maine](../maine/)
```
