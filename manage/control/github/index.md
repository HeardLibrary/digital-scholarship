# DiSC GitHub Lessons

A short link to this page is [vanderbi.lt/github](http://vanderbi.lt/github)

## About the lessons

DiSC GitHub lessons are provided by the [Digital Scholarship and Communications Office (DiSC)](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/).  The DiSC office provides regular lessons for GitHub beginners with a variety of followup intermediate lessons.  There is no cost associated with the lessons.

The beginners lessons generally cycle once per year, although they may be offered more frequently depending on demand.  See the schedule below for session details.  

Each beginner lesson includes of a series of videos and homework assignments. The live working sessions provide an opportunity for participants to ask questions about the lesson videos and homework, or to work on the homework with assistance. 

The lessons are part of a free, online learning system called [CodeGraf](../../../script/codegraf). You are welcome to work through these lessons or any of the other lesson modules available in CodeGraf on your own at any time (no registration required). To explore all of the lesson modules that are available, visit the [CodeGraf landing page](../../../script/codegraf). 

The DiSC office also provides [lessons for learning Python](http://vanderbi.lt/py) and [learning R](http://vanderbi.lt/r) in a similar format.

## Beginners Lessons - Spring 2022 

**Time:** Thursdays from 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM Central (US) Time (starting January 20).

**In-person venue** (starting January 27 unless changed): Central Library Poetry Room (room 612A). **Note:** I have been told that people with VUMC staff IDs are unable to swipe into the Central Library. (I think Medical School faculty, staff, and grad students can get in.)  If you are in this situation, you can participate by Zoom, or [contact Steve Baskauf](mailto:steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu) to figure out a method for you to get in.

**Instructor:** Steve Baskauf [office hours information](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/disc/officehours), or email [steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu](mailto:steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu) to arrange another time to talk.

Because of the uncertainty related to COVID 19, all participants should register through Zoom so that they can participate remotely if necessary. At least the first lesson will be remote. After that, you may choose to participate either remotely or in-person. After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the Zoom session.

Prior to the first lesson, you should sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/) if you don't already have one, and download the [GitHub Desktop software](https://desktop.github.com/) for your computer. You also need a text or code editor to use. I recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/) because of its Markdown preview, but it's fine to use a different one if you prefer.
