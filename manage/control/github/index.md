# DiSC GitHub Lessons

A short link to this page is [vanderbi.lt/github](http://vanderbi.lt/github)

## About the lessons

DiSC GitHub lessons are provided by the [Digital Scholarship and Communications Office (DiSC)](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/).  The DiSC office provides regular lessons for GitHub beginners with a variety of followup intermediate lessons.  There is no cost associated with the lessons.

The beginners lessons generally cycle once per semester.  See the schedule below for details.  There are videos for all lessons, so you can also work through them on your own.  

The DiSC office also provides [lessons for learning Python](http://vanderbi.lt/py) and [learning R](vanderbi.lt/r) in a similar format.

Before starting the lessons, you need to create a free GitHub account.  To open an account, go to <https://github.com/> and follow the directions.
