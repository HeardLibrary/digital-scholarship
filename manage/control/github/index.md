# DiSC GitHub Lessons

A short link to this page is [vanderbi.lt/github](http://vanderbi.lt/github)

## About the lessons

DiSC GitHub lessons are provided by the [Digital Scholarship and Communications Office (DiSC)](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/).  The DiSC office provides regular lessons for GitHub beginners with a variety of followup intermediate lessons.  There is no cost associated with the lessons.

The beginners lessons generally cycle once per year, although they may be offered more frequently depending on demand.  See the schedule below for session details.  

During the fall of 2021, we are planning to offer the lessons in-person, although it is also possible to participate via Zoom. Advance registration is required to participate remotely. It is recommended, but not required to participate in-person. To register, go to the link at the appropriate schedule below. After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the Zoom session.

Each beginner lesson includes of a series of videos and homework assignments. The live working sessions provide an opportunity for participants to ask questions about the lesson videos and homework, or to work on the homework with assistance. 

The lessons are part of a free, online learning system called [CodeGraf](../../../script/codegraf). You are welcome to work through these lessons or any of the other lesson modules available in CodeGraf on your own at any time (no registration required). To explore all of the lesson modules that are available, visit the [CodeGraf landing page](../../../script/codegraf). 

The DiSC office also provides [lessons for learning Python](http://vanderbi.lt/py) and [learning R](http://vanderbi.lt/r) in a similar format.

Before starting the lessons, you need to create a free GitHub account.  To open an account, go to <https://github.com/> and follow the directions.

## Managing websites using GitHub - fall of 2021 

Wednesdays from 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM Central (US) Time (starting Sep 7).

This hands-on series of lessons will quickly get you started creating a free website using GitHub pages. These lessons assume that you have a basic understanding of GitHub. However, those with no background using GitHub are welcome to attend since they can quickly catch up by doing the first two beginner lessons below. 

The lessons will be held in-person although remote participation via Zoom is welcome. Most lessons will be held in the Eskind Biomedical Library Training Room - EBL 010 (Lower Level), EXCEPT for lesson 2, which will be held in the Central Library Poetry Room (room 612A).

Please register using this Zoom registration link even if you plan to attend in-person. This will give you the opportunity to participate by Zoom if you can't make one of the live sessions. [Registration link](https://vanderbilt.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcuc-yhqz0uEtKkT5itfx22TC9AY9LX1OIV)

Prior to the first lesson, you should sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/) if you don't already have one, and download the [GitHub Desktop software](https://desktop.github.com/) for your computer.
