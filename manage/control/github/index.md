# DiSC GitHub Lessons

A short link to this page is [vanderbi.lt/github](http://vanderbi.lt/github)

## About the lessons

DiSC GitHub lessons are provided by the [Digital Scholarship and Communications Office (DiSC)](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/).  The DiSC office provides regular lessons for GitHub beginners with a variety of followup intermediate lessons.  There is no cost associated with the lessons.

The beginners lessons generally cycle once per semester.  See the schedule below for session details.  Advance registration and a Zoom login are required to attend the live working sessions. To register, go to the link at the schedule below. After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting.

Each lesson includes of a series of videos and homework assignments. The live Zoom working sessions are not class sessions. Rather, they provide an opportunity for participants to ask questions about the lesson videos and homework, or to work on the homework with assistance. 

You are also welcome to work through the lessons on your own at any time (no registration required).

The DiSC office also provides [lessons for learning Python](http://vanderbi.lt/py) and [learning R](http://vanderbi.lt/r) in a similar format.

Before starting the lessons, you need to create a free GitHub account.  To open an account, go to <https://github.com/> and follow the directions.
