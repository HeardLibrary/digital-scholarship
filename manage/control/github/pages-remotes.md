# Remote themes

The built-in themes provided by GitHub itself are few and not very sophisticated. However, there are [over a thousand freely available themes](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme) that have been created by others, and many of them have more features than the built-in themes. These themes are called *remote themes* because their styling is controlled by configuration details that are not included within the user's website. The theme developers maintain the themes and may update them periodically.

## Finding a theme

The [Jekyll documentation website](https://jekyllrb.com/) has a [themes page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) that provides links to four other websites that have extensive galleries showing what available themes look like when they are rendered. 

In most cases, the theme info page will link to a demo page that will show you what the theme looks like and will have a link to the GitHub site hosting the theme. For example, [academic](https://jamstackthemes.dev/theme/jekyll-academic/) is a theme for an academic website. There is a [demo page](https://jamstackthemes.dev/demo/theme/jekyll-academic/) and the [GitHub site](https://github.com/LeNPaul/academic) contains information about installing and configuring the site). We will use this site in the examples that follow.
