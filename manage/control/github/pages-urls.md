# Site URL options

A good URL for a website is both memorable and easy to type. In this lesson, we'll learn ways to create a good URL for your GitHub Pages website.

## The default site URL

In the first lesson, we saw that there was a relationship between the repository name and the URL at which the website pages will be displayed. Here's the pattern:

Repository URL pattern `https://github.com/accountname/repository/blob/branch/path`

Website URL pattern `https://accountname.github.io/repository/path`

The implication is that if you are going to have a meaningful URL for your site without paying for a custom domain, you would like to have both account and repository names that tell the users something about your site. For example, 

<img src="../images-pages/remote_url.png" alt="URL for GitHub repo for remote theme" style="border:1px solid black">
