# Version Control

## What is version control?

Version control is a system to record changes to files over time.  It makes it possible to track changes in a project over time and to revert back to a previous version if something goes wrong.  Version control is also frequently used to manage collaboration among multiple contributors to a project.

# Version control systems

## Git and Github

One of the most commonly used version control systems is Git.  Git is a system that operates on your computer to control interactions between it and a server that centrally manages the version control.
