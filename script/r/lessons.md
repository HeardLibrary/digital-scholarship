# DiSC R Lessons

A shortened link to this page is [vanderbi.lt/r](http://vanderbi.lt/r).

## About the lessons

DiSC R lessons are provided by the [Digital Scholarship and Communications Office (DiSC)](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/).  The DiSC office provides regular lessons for R beginners and occasional special topics lessons.  Registration is required - go to [this form](https://forms.gle/BDrnAg8aHvDRvz4i9) to register for the first cycle beginner lessons. There is no cost associated with the lessons.

The beginners lessons generally cycle twice per semester.  See the schedule below for details.  You are also encouraged to work through the lessons on your own.   

The DiSC office also provides [lessons for learning Python](https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/script/python/wg/) in a similar format.

## Venue

We meet in the Eskind Training Room (Room 010 in the basement of the Eskind Biomedical Library).  To get there, walk past the circulation desk and veer to the left.  Take the elevators or stair down one floor, then turn right when you come out.
