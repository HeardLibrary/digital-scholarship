# DiSC R Lessons

A shortened link to this page is [vanderbi.lt/r](http://vanderbi.lt/r).

## About the lessons

DiSC R lessons are provided by the [Digital Scholarship and Communications Office (DiSC)](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/).  The DiSC office provides regular lessons for R beginners with a variety of followup intermediate and advanced lessons.  There is no cost associated with the lessons.

The beginners lessons are generally offered at least once per semester.  In the fall semester of 2021, we are also offering an intermediate series on data visualization using ggplot. See the schedules below for session details.  

During the fall of 2021, we are planning to offer the lessons in-person, although it is also possible to participate remotely via Zoom. Advance registration is required to participate remotely. It is recommended, but not required to participate in-person. To register, go to the link at the appropriate schedule below. After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the Zoom session.

Each lesson includes of a series of videos with a practice scripts and homework assignments. The live working sessions provide an opportunity for participants to ask questions about the lesson videos and homework, or to work on the homework with assistance. 

The lessons are part of a free, online learning system called [CodeGraf](../../codegraf). You are welcome to work through these lessons or any of the other lesson modules available in CodeGraf on your own at any time (no registration required). To explore all of the lesson modules that are available, visit the [CodeGraf landing page](../../codegraf). 

The DiSC office also provides [lessons for learning Python](http://vanderbi.lt/py) and [getting started with GitHub](http://vanderbi.lt/github) in a similar format.

## Beginners Lessons - Fall 2021

Wednesdays from 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM Central (US) Time (starting Sep 1). 

**NOTE CHANGE OF VENUE:** Central Library Poetry Room - 612A (Sep 1 through 29) and 
Central Library room 800BB on October 6 ONLY.

Please register using this Zoom registration link even if you plan to attend in-person. This will give you the opportunity to participate by Zoom if you can't make one of the live sessions. [Registration link](https://vanderbilt.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJItd-CgrDMoE9M5guUCPfxagVl0QEl1QpnT)

If you don't already have RStudio installed on your computer, I recommend starting with RStudio Cloud. It behaves exactly like RStudio desktop but does not require any installation. Create an account at <https://rstudio.cloud/> before the first lesson to save time.

Instructor (Steve Baskauf) [office hours information](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/disc/officehours), or email [steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu](mailto:steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu) to arrange another time to talk.

## Introduction to data visualization with ggplot (Intermediate topic) - Fall 2021

This hands-on lesson series will quickly get you started using the R library `ggplot` to create data visualizations. These lessons assume that you have a basic familiarity with R and RStudio. However, those with no background can still participate by trying and modifying the provided code examples. To visualize your own data, you will want to work through the beginner lessons (offered concurrently, see above) either on your own, or as part of the lesson cohort. 

Fridays from 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM Central (US) Time (starting Sep 3). 

**NOTE CHANGE OF VENUE:** Central Library Poetry Room - 612A (Sep 3 - Oct 1) and 
Central Library room 800BB on October 8 ONLY.

Please register using this Zoom registration link even if you plan to attend in-person. This will give you the opportunity to participate by Zoom if you can't make one of the live sessions. [Registration link](https://vanderbilt.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUuc-yorTsvGtBNHm9y74IFbHwTno6i2Zbo)
