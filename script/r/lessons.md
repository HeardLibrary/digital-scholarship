# DiSC R Lessons

A shortened link to this page is [vanderbi.lt/r](http://vanderbi.lt/r).

## About the lessons

DiSC R lessons are provided by the [Digital Scholarship and Communications Office (DiSC)](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/).  The DiSC office provides regular lessons for R beginners and occasional special topics lessons.  There is no cost associated with the lessons.

The beginners lessons generally cycle twice per semester.  See the schedule below for details.  You are also encouraged to work through the lessons on your own.   

The DiSC office also provides [lessons for learning Python](https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/script/python/wg/) in a similar format.
