# DiSC R Lessons

A shortened link to this page is [vanderbi.lt/r](http://vanderbi.lt/r).

## About the lessons

DiSC R lessons are provided by the [Digital Scholarship and Communications Office (DiSC)](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/).  The DiSC office provides regular lessons for R beginners and occasional special topics lessons.  There is no cost associated with the lessons.

The beginners lessons generally cycle twice per semester.  See the schedule below for details.  You are also encouraged to work through the lessons on your own.   

The DiSC office also provides [lessons for learning Python](https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/script/python/wg/) in a similar format.

## Schedule of Beginners Lessons - Spring 2020

Second cycle: **Fridays** from 1:10 to 2:00 PM.  [Register here](https://forms.gle/nege53mCTEKyXZcH6)

To download an R script, click on the link.  Then:

- (method 1) On the resulting page, right-click on the `Raw` button and select `Save link as...` (or similar).  Download the script to some place where you can find it. Open the file in RStudio using `File`, then `Open file`.
- (method 2) On the resulting page, left-click on the Raw button. Select all of the text on the page, then copy it.  In RStudio, go to `File`, then `New File`, then `R Script`.  In the resulting editor pane, paste the text you copied.  You can save the file if you care about preserving your work.

**Connection details**

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the beginners lessons will be held online using Zoom. Here is the information needed to connect to the meetings:

Although the class is scheduled to begin at 1:10, we'll plan to be online at 1:00 to give people a chance to get connected. If you haven't used Zoom before, after you click the "Join Zoom Meeting" link, you'll be prompted to download the Zoom web app if you don't already have it.  After you give the app permission to connect, you'll be given an opportunity to test your microphone and sound to make sure that it's working.  If your sound is working, you can join using computer audio. If it's not working, you can with audio by phone using one of the numbers listed above. It's good to try to connect a few minutes ahead of the start of the meeting because it can take a few minutes to get set up if it's your first time.
 
I've set the meeting so that your camera is turned on and your microphone is turned off when you join the meeting. If you don't like the idea of your camera being turned on, you can "mute" it using the button at the bottom of the Zoom app window. It's best if everyone leaves their microphones turned off unless you want to say something because there tends to be a lot of feedback if many participants have their microphones turned on. It's fine to unmute your microphone if you want to ask a question. I'm planning to record the first session so that anyone who is traveling or otherwise can't attend will be able to catch up for the second meeting.
 
Zoom also has a chat feature that can be accessed by clicking on a button at the bottom of the screen. I'll have the chat window open during the presentation so that I can see any questions that people type there during the class.
