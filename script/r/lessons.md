# DiSC R Lessons

A shortened link to this page is [vanderbi.lt/r](http://vanderbi.lt/r).

## About the lessons

DiSC R lessons are provided by the [Digital Scholarship and Communications Office (DiSC)](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/).  The DiSC office provides regular lessons for R beginners with a variety of followup intermediate and advanced lessons.  There is no cost associated with the lessons.

The beginners lessons generally cycle twice per semester.  See the schedule below for details.  There are videos for all lessons, so you can also work through them on your own.  

The DiSC office also provides [lessons for learning Python](http://vanderbi.lt/py) and [getting started with GitHub](http://vanderbi.lt/github) in a similar format.
