# Digital Lab R Lessons

A shortened link to this page is [vanderbi.lt/r](http://vanderbi.lt/r).

## About the lessons

R lessons are provided by the [Digital Lab](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/digital-lab/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/).  The Digital Lab provides regular lessons for R beginners with a variety of followup intermediate lessons.  There is no cost associated with the lessons.

The beginners lessons are generally offered once per semester.  See the schedule below for session details.  

Each lesson includes of a series of videos with a practice scripts and homework assignments. The live working sessions provide an opportunity for participants to ask questions about the lesson videos and homework, or to work on the homework with assistance. 

The lessons are part of a free, online learning system called [CodeGraf](../../codegraf). You are welcome to work through these lessons or any of the other lesson modules available in CodeGraf on your own at any time (no registration required). To explore all of the lesson modules that are available, visit the [CodeGraf landing page](../../codegraf). 

The Digital Lab also provides [lessons for learning Python](http://vanderbi.lt/py) and [getting started with GitHub](http://vanderbi.lt/github) in a similar format.

## Beginners Lessons - Spring 2023

**Time:** Wednesdays from 1:00-2:00 PM Central (US) Time (starting March 22). 

**Venue** Synchronously on Zoom. [Registration link](https://vanderbilt.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYrcOmorTgsHtW74vWxpL-Ac2JWDiYUMIHj). After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the Zoom session.

**Instructor:** Steve Baskauf. Email [steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu](mailto:steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu) to arrange a time to talk.

I will be presenting the lessons using RStudio in the cloud using the Posit Cloud platform. It behaves almost exactly like RStudio desktop but does not require any installation. Create an account at <https://posit.cloud/> before the first lesson to save time, then go through the [Posit Cloud quickstart](../../codegraf/003b/) lesson if you haven't used RStudio before. It includes 8 minutes of videos.

You are welcome to use desktop RStudio if you already have it installed, but we will not be spending time going over the installation process. There are some [installation videos](../../codegraf/003/) that you are welcome to watch if you want to do an installation yourself. Stop on the page after the `Installing Anaconda` section.

If you have never programmed before, I recommend that you work through two optional lessons on your own: [terminology](../../codegraf/001/) (18 min) and [programming environments](../../codegraf/002/) (50 min). I will assume that you are familiar with the concepts and terms covered in these lessons as we work through the actual R lessons.

| Working session date | Lesson | Topic | Web pages (times are total video length) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mar 22 | 1 | Basics: Vectors and vectorized computing, packages | [lesson videos](../../codegraf/011/) (45 min) |
| Mar 29 | 2 | Lists and dataframes, tibbles | [lesson videos](../../codegraf/012/) (40 min) |
| Apr 5 | 3 | Missing data, basic stats, basic plots | [lesson videos](../../codegraf/013/) (47 min) |
| Apr 12 | 4 | Tidy Data and basic data wrangling | [lesson videos](../../codegraf/014a/) (31 min) |
| Apr 19 | 5 | More data wrangling and piping | [lesson videos](../../codegraf/014b/) (45 min)  |
