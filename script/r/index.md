# Online R Resources

[Software Carpentry Programming with R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)

[Software Carpentry R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/)

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) This link is to the online version of Grolemund, G and H. Wickham, *R for Data Science*.  It is also available in print version from O'Reilly via a link on the website.  This is the book that is used in the Vanderbilt Libraries' [R Working Group](https://commodore-r-group.github.io/).

[Online R resources for Beginners](http://www.introductoryr.co.uk/R_Resources_for_Beginners.html) is a page of links to many other R online resources, including online books, video tutorials, and other websites.

[An R Companion for the Handbook of Biological Statistics](http://rcompanion.org/rcompanion/) is the code supplement for the online [Handbook of Biological Statistics](http://www.biostathandbook.com/) by John H. McDonald.  The examples include many of the most common parametric and non-parametric statistical tests, including some of the simpler multivariate tests.

[R examples for *The Analysis of Biological Data*](http://whitlockschluter.zoology.ubc.ca/r-code) is a companion website for the very accessible Witlock and Schluter print text *The Analysis of Biological Data*.  

If you are already familiar with basic statistical tests and want a jump start to doing those tests using R, [Basic Statistical Analysis Using the R Statistical Package](http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/BS/R/R-Manual/index.html) by Heeren and Milton of the Boston University School of Public Health is a good place to start.

For summaries of how to perform a variety of tasks using the RStudio IDE, see the [RStudio cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).

To try out some simple R scripts for t-test of means, paired t-test, chi-squared goodness of fit, chi-squared contingency, regression, and ANOVA, visit [this page](../stats/).
