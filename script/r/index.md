# Getting started with R and RStudio

The following links lead to a series of lessons designed to help you get started with R and RStudio.  They are designed to be studied sequentially.

[1. Installing R and RStudio](install)

[2. Navigating around in RStudio](navigate)

[3. Introduction to R data structures](structures)

[4. Where do I go from here?](next)

## R lessons at Vanderbilt

Go to the [lessons home page](lessons/) for information, schedule, and registration.


# Online R Resources

## Software and Data Carpentries lessons

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) is an educational program that provides in person workshops and online resources to teach fundamental coding and data science skills.  There are several Carpentries lessons for getting started with R:

[Data Carpentry: Data Analysis and Visualization in R](https://datacarpentry.org/R-genomics/). This lesson follows a sequence very similar to the [DiSC R lessons](lessons/), discussing basics, data structures, manipulating tables, and visualization. The *Introduction to R* sesson includes some useful information about getting help.

[Data Carpentry: Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/).  This lesson follows a similar sequence as the [DiSC R lessons](lessons/), although it includes additional information about using R with SQL.

[Software Carpentry: R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/). This lesson begins with data structures and subsetting data. It then discusses conditional statements and visualization buty saves maniuplation of data tables until later. 

[Software Carpentry: Programming with R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/). This lesson is focused on teaching R as a programming language and starts with traditional programming features like functions, conditional statements, and loops. Tables and files are introduced later. 

## O'Reilly for Higher Education (Vanderbilt sign-in required)

Vanderbilt has a submscription to *O'Reilly for Higher Education* which provides access to many books and video tutorials.  You can get there directly via [this link](http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/eres?id=1676).  It is also possible to navigate there by going to <https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/>, select `DATABASES A-Z`, click on `O`, then select `O'Reilly for Higher Education`.  **Important note:** it is important to sign out and close your browser tab when finished.  Otherwise you may not be able to log in again withoug clearing your browser cookies.

## Other online websites

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) This link is to the online version of Grolemund, G and H. Wickham, *R for Data Science*.  It is also available in print version from O'Reilly via a link on the website (accessible online via Vanderbilt's [O'Reilly for Higher Education](http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/eres?id=1676) subscription).

[R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/) by Winston Chang provides many recipes for generating high-quality graphs quickly using R.

[Online R resources for Beginners](http://www.introductoryr.co.uk/R_Resources_for_Beginners.html) is a page of links to many other R online resources, including online books, video tutorials, and other websites.

[An R Companion for the Handbook of Biological Statistics](http://rcompanion.org/rcompanion/) is the code supplement for the online [Handbook of Biological Statistics](http://www.biostathandbook.com/) by John H. McDonald.  The examples include many of the most common parametric and non-parametric statistical tests, including some of the simpler multivariate tests.

[R examples for *The Analysis of Biological Data*](http://whitlockschluter.zoology.ubc.ca/r-code) is a companion website for the very accessible Whitlock and Schluter print text *The Analysis of Biological Data*.  

If you are already familiar with basic statistical tests and want a jump start to doing those tests using R, [Basic Statistical Analysis Using the R Statistical Package](http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/BS/R/R-Manual/index.html) by Heeren and Milton of the Boston University School of Public Health is a good place to start.

For summaries of how to perform a variety of tasks using the RStudio IDE, see the [RStudio cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).

To try out some simple R scripts for t-test of means, paired t-test, chi-squared goodness of fit, chi-squared contingency, regression, and ANOVA, visit [this page](stats/).
