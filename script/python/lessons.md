# DiSC Python Lessons

A shortened link to this page is [vanderbi.lt/py](http://vanderbi.lt/py).

## About the lessons

DiSC Python lessons are provided by the [Digital Scholarship and Communications Office (DiSC)](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/).  The DiSC office provides regular lessons for Python beginners with a variety of followup intermediate and advanced lessons. There is no cost associated with the lessons.

The beginners lessons are generally offered at least once per semester.  See the schedule below for session details.   

Each lesson includes of a series of videos with a practice Jupyter/Colab notebook and homework assignments. The live working sessions provide an opportunity for participants to ask questions about the lesson videos and homework, or to work on the homework with assistance.  

The lessons are part of a free, online learning system called [CodeGraf](../../codegraf). You are welcome to work through these lessons or any of the other lesson modules available in CodeGraf on your own at any time (no registration required). To explore all of the lesson modules that are available, visit the [CodeGraf landing page](../../codegraf). 

The DiSC office also provides [lessons for learning R](http://vanderbi.lt/r) and [getting started with GitHub](http://vanderbi.lt/github) in a similar format.

## Beginners Lessons - Fall 2022

**Time:** Thursdays from 1:00-2:00 PM Central (US) Time (starting September 1). 

**Instructor:** Steve Baskauf. Email [steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu](mailto:steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu) to arrange a time to talk.

I will be presenting the lessons using Colab notebooks. They behaves very similarly to the popular Jupyter notebooks but do not require any installation. They do require you to have a Google account.

You are welcome to use desktop Jupyter notebook if you already have it installed, but we will not be spending time going over the installation process. There are some [installation videos](../../codegraf/003/) that you are welcome to watch if you want to do an installation yourself. The practice notebooks are also available as downloadable Jupyter notebooks.

| Working session date | Lesson | Topic | Web page (times are total video length) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sep 1 | 1 | Introduction and examples | [terminology](../../codegraf/001/) recommended, but optional (18 min) / [programming environments](../../codegraf/002/) recommended, but optional (50 min) / [Colab quickstart](../../codegraf/003a/) required (14 min) |
| Sep 8 | 2 | Programming basics | [lesson videos](../../codegraf/004/) (67 min) |
| Sep 15 | 3 | Code libraries | [lesson videos](../../codegraf/005/) (34 min) |
| Sep 22 | 4 | List and dictionary objects | [lesson videos](../../codegraf/006a/) (32 min) |
| Sep 29 | 5 | Loops | [lesson videos](../../codegraf/006b/) (33 min lessons, 61 min including demos) |
| Oct 6 | 6 | Conditional execution | [lesson videos](../../codegraf/006c/) (44 min) |


## Introduction to pandas and Matplotlib - Fall 2022

**Time:** Wednesdays from 1:00-2:00 PM Central (US) Time (starting November 2). 

**Venue:** Virtually via Zoom. **NOTE: the in-person option is no longer available.** [Registration link](https://vanderbilt.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYscOygrDsuHtZW57LmvcVL2PzPInvSTH50). After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the Zoom session. 

**Instructor:** Steve Baskauf. Email [steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu](mailto:steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu) to arrange a time to talk.

These lessons will introduce the key features of pandas with an emphasis on reusable code examples and typical ways to create visualizations from DataFrames. This is an intermediate level series that assumes you have a basic understanding of how Python operates and of basic Python objects like lists and dictionaries. If you are new to Python, I recommend working through the beginner exercises (above), either on your own or as part of the synchronous lesson series. However, even without this background, you may be able to use the examples, although your understanding of what's going on will probably be hindered.

The lessons may be done either with Colab (cloud-based) notebooks or locally-installed Jupyter notebooks. For information about installing the Jupyter notebook system, see the links in the Beginner lessons above. Since we want to be able to code using our own data files, it is helpful if you are familiar navigating and manipulating files in either Google Drive (if using Colab) or your own (Windows or Mac) operating system (if using local Jupyter notebooks).

This is a new lesson series, so the exact content below is subject to change.

| Working session date | Lesson | Topic | Web page (times are total video length) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nov 2 | 1 | Introduction to pandas Series | [optional lesson on NumPy](../../codegraf/007/) (53 min) / [lesson videos](../../codegraf/008/) (34 min) |
| Nov 9 | 2 | Introduction to pandas DataFrames: loading data and easy operations | [lesson videos](../../codegraf/009a/) (56 min) |
| Nov 16 | 3 | Extracting and changing data in DataFrames | [lesson videos](../../codegraf/009b/) (25 min) / [optional lesson on summarizing and rearanging DataFrames](../../codegraf/009c/) (18 min) |
| Nov 30 | 4 | Introduction to Matplotlib | [lesson videos](../../codegraf/010/) (22 min, 42 min with optional videos) |
