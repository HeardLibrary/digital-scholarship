# Digital Lab Python Lessons

A shortened link to this page is [vanderbi.lt/py](http://vanderbi.lt/py).

## About the lessons

Digital Lab Python lessons are provided by the [Digital Lab](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/disc/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/).  The Digital Lab provides regular lessons for Python beginners with a variety of followup intermediate and advanced lessons. There is no cost associated with the lessons.

The beginners lessons are generally offered at least once per semester.  See the schedule below for session details.   

Each lesson includes of a series of videos with a practice Jupyter notebook and homework assignments. The live sessions will demonstrate how to code the practice assignments with the assistance of GitHub Copilot, a generative AI-based plugin for VS Code. 

The lessons are part of a free, online learning system called [CodeGraf](../../codegraf). You are welcome to work through these lessons or any of the other lesson modules available in CodeGraf on your own at any time (no registration required). To explore all of the lesson modules that are available, visit the [CodeGraf landing page](../../codegraf). 

The Digital Lab also provides [lessons for learning R](http://vanderbi.lt/r) and [getting started with GitHub](http://vanderbi.lt/github) in a similar format.

## Introduction to Python with GitHub Copilot - Spring 2024

**Time:** Tuesdays from 1:00-2:00 PM Central (US) Time (starting January 16). 

**Venue:** In-person in the Digital Lab, 4th floor Central Library. Resistration is preferred, although walk-ins are OK. [Registration link](https://forms.gle/nbhE7La2xQA1MQQj6). 

**Instructor:** Steve Baskauf. Email [steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu](mailto:steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu) to arrange a time to talk.

**Important note: You should apply for free educational access to GitHub Copilot as soon as possible, since there is often a delay in getting access.** See below for details.

I will be presenting the lessons using Jupyter notebooks in the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) environment. Before you come on the first day, you should do two things: apply for free educational access to GitHub Copilot and install VS Code and a Jupyter environment. There are instructions for these two tasks on the [setup page](../../codegraf/003c/). You can use either of the two options for installing a Jupyter environment. At the first lesson, we will troubleshoot any problems you had with the installation and finish the setup of VS Code to use the GitHub Copilot plugin. Copilot is generally a paid service, however, people with an academic email address have free access. So if you have a `vanderbilt.edu` email address, you will be able to use this feature for free. Using Copilot is not required, but it makes the coding process much easier.

If you have never programmed before, I recommend that you work through two optional lessons on your own: [terminology](../../codegraf/001/) (18 min) and [programming environments](../../codegraf/002/) (50 min). I will assume that you are familiar with the concepts and terms covered in these lessons as we work through the actual Python lessons.
