# Python Working Group

## About the group

The Python Working Group is a working group of the [Digital Scholarship and Communications Office (DiSC)](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/).  The purpose of the group is twofold: to help beginning participants get started using Python, and to help existing Python users solve practical problems.

The group lessons generally cycle twice per semester.  See the schedule below for details.  You are also encouraged to work through the lessons on your own.  They contain practice exercises, with answers.  

In the second half of the 2019 fall semester, the DiSC office is planning an intermediate-level series of lessons on APIs and web scraping.  These lessons will take place on Fridays, from 1:10 to 2:00 PM, starting November 1.  For more information, [contact Steve Baskauf](mailto:steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu).

## Venue

The Working Group meets in the Eskind Training Room (Room 010 in the basement of the Eskind Biomedical Library).  To get there, walk past the circulation desk and veer to the left.  Take the elevators or stair down one floor, then turn right when you come out.
