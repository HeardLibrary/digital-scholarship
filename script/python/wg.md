# DiSC Python Lessons

A shortened link to this page is [vanderbi.lt/py](http://vanderbi.lt/py).

## About the lessons

DiSC Python lessons are provided by the [Digital Scholarship and Communications Office (DiSC)](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/).  The DiSC office provides regular lessons for Python beginners with a variety of followup intermediate and advanced lessons. There is no cost associated with the lessons.

The beginners lessons generally cycle twice per semester.  See the schedule below for session details.  Advance registration and a Zoom login are required to attend the live working sessions. To register, go to the link at the schedule below. After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting.

Each lesson includes of a series of videos with a practice Jupyter notebook and homework assignments. The live Zoom working sessions are not class sessions. Rather, they provide an opportunity for participants to ask questions about the lesson videos and homework, or to work on the homework with assistance. 

The lessons are part of a free, online learning system called [CodeGraf](../../codegraf). You are welcome to work through these lessons or any of the other lesson modules available in CodeGraf on your own at any time (no registration required). To explore all of the lesson modules that are available, visit the [CodeGraf landing page](../../codegraf). 

The DiSC office also provides [lessons for learning R](http://vanderbi.lt/r) and [getting started with GitHub](http://vanderbi.lt/github) in a similar format.
