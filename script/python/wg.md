# DiSC Python Lessons

A shortened link to this page is [vanderbi.lt/py](http://vanderbi.lt/py).

## About the lessons

DiSC Python lessons are provided by the [Digital Scholarship and Communications Office (DiSC)](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/).  The DiSC office provides regular lessons for Python beginners and occasional special topics lessons. There is no cost associated with the lessons.

The beginners lessons generally cycle twice per semester.  See the schedule below for details.  You are also encouraged to work through the lessons on your own.  They contain practice exercises, with answers.  

On March 19, the DiSC office will begin a series of intermediate lessons focused on data analysis and visualization with Python. See the schedule below for details.

The DiSC office also provides [lessons for learning R](https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/script/r/lessons) in a similar format.

Although the class is scheduled to begin at 1:10, we'll plan to be online at 1:00 to give people a chance to get connected. If you haven't used Zoom before, after you click the "Join Zoom Meeting" link, you'll be prompted to download the Zoom web app if you don't already have it.  After you give the app permission to connect, you'll be given an opportunity to test your microphone and sound to make sure that it's working.  If your sound is working, you can join using computer audio. If it's not working, you can with audio by phone using one of the numbers listed above. It's good to try to connect a few minutes ahead of the start of the meeting because it can take a few minutes to get set up if it's your first time.
 
I've set the meeting so that your camera is turned on and your microphone is turned off when you join the meeting. If you don't like the idea of your camera being turned on, you can "mute" it using the button at the bottom of the Zoom app window. It's best if everyone leaves their microphones turned off unless you want to say something because there tends to be a lot of feedback if many participants have their microphones turned on. It's fine to unmute your microphone if you want to ask a question.
 
Zoom also has a chat feature that can be accessed by clicking on a button at the bottom of the screen. I'll try to have the chat window open during the presentation so that I can see any questions that people type there during the class.

## Intermediate Lessons on Data Analysis and Visualization - Spring 2020

These lessons will be taught by Dr. Sanjay Mishra of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Center and former Data Science instructor at the Nashville Software School. They will focus on analyzing and visualizing large data sets with Python and will use Pandas and Matplotlib. The lessons assume that you have basic Python skills and will use Jupyter notebooks as a computing platform. 

**Thursdays** from 11:10 AM to noon. [Register here](https://forms.gle/cT27q4yjNexu9Xkk8)

| Date | Session | Topic | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mar 19 | 1 | Importing data (Pandas, slicing) | |
| Mar 26 | 2 | Creating figures with Matplotlib | |
| Apr 2 | 3 | Curve fitting and regression | |
| Apr 9 | 4 | Basic image processing |  |
| Apr 16 | 5 | Reproducible results: notebooks, LaTex, and presentations |  |
