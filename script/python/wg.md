# Python Working Group

A shortened link to this page is [vanderbi.lt/py](http://vanderbi.lt/py).

## About the group

The Python Working Group is a working group of the [Digital Scholarship and Communications Office (DiSC)](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/).  The group provides regular lessons for Python beginners and occasional special topics lessons.  Registration is required - go to [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPgczgC0XquvLzCeXLpQc7Ojw9YdN0_uhd1Q8NAp1NWSt-MQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to register for the second cycle beginner lessons or to [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScaC3yV6DE50OEWFx7klDOJH3w-zs03g-4ViatzXKAoRopo7w/viewform?usp=sf_link) to register for the API/web scraping lessons.

The beginners lessons generally cycle twice per semester.  See the schedule below for details.  You are also encouraged to work through the lessons on your own.  They contain practice exercises, with answers.  

In the second half of the 2019 fall semester, the DiSC office is planning an intermediate-level series of lessons on APIs and web scraping using Python.  See the schedule below.

In the fall 2019 semester, the DiSC office is also sponsoring a working group on using Python in GIS: [vanderbi.lt/gis](https://sites.google.com/view/vugis/home). 

## Venue

The Working Group meets in the Eskind Training Room (Room 010 in the basement of the Eskind Biomedical Library).  To get there, walk past the circulation desk and veer to the left.  Take the elevators or stair down one floor, then turn right when you come out.
