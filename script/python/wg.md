# DiSC Python Lessons

A shortened link to this page is [vanderbi.lt/py](http://vanderbi.lt/py).

## About the lessons

DiSC Python lessons are provided by the [Digital Scholarship and Communications Office (DiSC)](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/).  The DiSC office provides regular lessons for Python beginners and occasional special topics lessons.  Registration is required - go to [this form](https://forms.gle/nM4N2bYRmG7BA8z27) to register for the first cycle beginner lessons.

The beginners lessons generally cycle twice per semester.  See the schedule below for details.  You are also encouraged to work through the lessons on your own.  They contain practice exercises, with answers.  

In the second half of the 2020 spring semester, the DiSC office may present an intermediate-level series of lessons on working with large data sets.  Stay tuned for further information.

The DiSC office also provides [lessons for learning R](https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/script/r/lessons) in a similar format.

## Venue

We meet in the Eskind Training Room (Room 010 in the basement of the Eskind Biomedical Library).  To get there, walk past the circulation desk and veer to the left.  Take the elevators or stair down one floor, then turn right when you come out.
