# DiSC Python Lessons

A shortened link to this page is [vanderbi.lt/py](http://vanderbi.lt/py).

## About the lessons

DiSC Python lessons are provided by the [Digital Scholarship and Communications Office (DiSC)](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/).  The DiSC office provides regular lessons for Python beginners with a variety of followup intermediate and advanced lessons. There is no cost associated with the lessons.

The beginners lessons are generally offered at least once per semester.  See the schedule below for session details.   

Each lesson includes of a series of videos with a practice Jupyter/Colab notebook and homework assignments. The live working sessions provide an opportunity for participants to ask questions about the lesson videos and homework, or to work on the homework with assistance.  

The lessons are part of a free, online learning system called [CodeGraf](../../codegraf). You are welcome to work through these lessons or any of the other lesson modules available in CodeGraf on your own at any time (no registration required). To explore all of the lesson modules that are available, visit the [CodeGraf landing page](../../codegraf). 

The DiSC office also provides [lessons for learning R](http://vanderbi.lt/r) and [getting started with GitHub](http://vanderbi.lt/github) in a similar format.

**Special note for spring 2022:** We are offering a new workshop series on [QT Py Computer Workshop Series: Microcontrollers with CircuitPython](http://vanderbi.lt/circuitpython), which teaches you how to program microcontroller boards with CircuitPython.

I will be presenting the lessons using Colab notebooks. They behaves very similarly to the popular Jupyter notebooks but do not require any installation. They do require you to have a Google account.

You are welcome to use desktop Jupyter notebook if you already have it installed, but we will not be spending time going over the installation process. There are some [installation videos](../../codegraf/003/) that you are welcome to watch if you want to do an installation yourself. The practice notebooks are also available as downloadable Jupyter notebooks.
