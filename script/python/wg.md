# DiSC Python Lessons

A shortened link to this page is [vanderbi.lt/py](http://vanderbi.lt/py).

## About the lessons

DiSC Python lessons are provided by the [Digital Scholarship and Communications Office (DiSC)](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/).  The DiSC office provides regular lessons for Python beginners and occasional special topics lessons. There is no cost associated with the lessons.

The beginners lessons generally cycle twice per semester.  See the schedule below for details.  You are also encouraged to work through the lessons on your own.  They contain practice exercises, with answers.  

The DiSC office also provides [lessons for learning R](https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/script/r/lessons) in a similar format.

## Archive of Intermediate Lessons on Data Analysis and Visualization - Spring 2020

These lessons were taught by Dr. Sanjay Mishra, Staff Scientist in the Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center and former Data Science instructor at the Nashville Software School. They focused on analyzing and visualizing large data sets with Python and used Pandas and Matplotlib. The lessons assume that you have basic Python skills. The examples use Microsoft Azure hosted Jupyter notebooks, which you can access them with any Microsoft compatible login credentials, including Vanderbilt / VUMC logins. If you have a functioning Anaconda installation on your local computer you can download the Jupyter notebooks and run them locally. 

Dr. Mishra recommends the book *Python for Data Analysis - Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython* by William (Wes) McKinney as a reference for this lesson. Vanderbilt users can access the eBook through the Heard Libraries subscription to O'Reilly For Higher Education media (VUNet ID and password required) at [this link](https://catalog.library.vanderbilt.edu/permalink/01VAN_INST/6ll2l/alma991043601866403276). Non-Vanderbilt users can access a free PDF of the first edition of the similar *pandas: powerful Python data analysis toolkit* at [the Pandas home page](https://pandas.pydata.org/). To access the code examples, go to [Wes McKinney's GitHub site](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book) and click on the appropriate IPython Notebook for the chapter. **Note**: *IPython* is an older name for *Jupyter notebooks*.
