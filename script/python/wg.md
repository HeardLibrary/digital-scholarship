# Python Working Group

## About the group

The Python Working Group is a working group of the [Digital Scholarship and Scholarly Communications Office](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/).  The purpose of the group is twofold: to help beginning participants get started using Python, and to help existing Python users solve practical problems.

The group meets weekly throughout the semester.  Each session is composed of two parts: an introductory session (12:10-1:00 PM) focused on helping new users, and a free-format second hour (1:00-2:00 PM) where participants can work on particular problems they are facing.  Participants in the first hour are welcome to stay for the second hour to get additional help with the new concepts that have been introduced.  Participants are also welcomd to arrive at the meeting at the start of the second hour if they just want to workshop a problem that they are having.

## Venue

The Working Group meets in the Eskind Training Room (Room 010 in the basement of the Eskind Biomedical Library).  To get there, walk past the circulation desk and veer to the left.  Take the elevators or stair down one floor, then turn right when you come out.
