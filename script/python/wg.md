# DiSC Python Lessons

A shortened link to this page is [vanderbi.lt/py](http://vanderbi.lt/py).

## About the lessons

DiSC Python lessons are provided by the [Digital Scholarship and Communications Office (DiSC)](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/).  The DiSC office provides regular lessons for Python beginners with a variety of followup intermediate and advanced lessons. There is no cost associated with the lessons.

The beginners lessons are generally offered at least once per semester.  See the schedule below for session details.   

During the fall of 2021, we are planning to offer the lessons in-person, although it is also possible to participate via Zoom. Advance registration is required to participate remotely. It is recommended, but not required to participate in-person. To register, go to the link at the appropriate schedule below. After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the Zoom session.

Each lesson includes of a series of videos with a practice Jupyter notebook and homework assignments. The live working sessions provide an opportunity for participants to ask questions about the lesson videos and homework, or to work on the homework with assistance.  

The lessons are part of a free, online learning system called [CodeGraf](../../codegraf). You are welcome to work through these lessons or any of the other lesson modules available in CodeGraf on your own at any time (no registration required). To explore all of the lesson modules that are available, visit the [CodeGraf landing page](../../codegraf). 

The DiSC office also provides [lessons for learning R](http://vanderbi.lt/r) and [getting started with GitHub](http://vanderbi.lt/github) in a similar format.

## Beginners Lessons - Fall 2021

Wednesdays from 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM Central (US) Time (starting Oct 20). 

**Due to the large number of registrants, we will be holding the first session in the Community Room of the Central Library.** Based on the number of attendees, I'll decide whether or not to hold the subsequent sessions in the Central Library Poetry Room (612A) as planned.

To get to the Community Room, turn right after entering the front door of the Central Library building. Walk all the way to the end of the hall and the Community Room is the large room on your left. **Note:** I have been told that people with VUMC staff IDs are unable to swipe into the Central Library. (I think Medical School faculty, staff, and grad students can get in.)  If you are in this situation, you can participate by Zoom, or contact me at [contact Steve Baskauf](mailto:steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu) to figure out a method for you to get in.

Please register using this Zoom registration link even if you plan to attend in-person. This will give you the opportunity to participate by Zoom if you can't make one of the live sessions. [Registration link](https://vanderbilt.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUlcu2gqDosHtfmivBsEfJXfZrQ9z8_DRuk)

Instructor (Steve Baskauf) [office hours information](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/disc/officehours), or email [steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu](mailto:steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu) to arrange another time to talk.
