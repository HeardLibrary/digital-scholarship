# Some code examples to try

## Retrieving libraries that aren't in the standard library

Some modules that aren't included in the standard libary must be retrieved using the PIP application.  If you receive an error message saying that a package can't be found, retrieve it at the command line (in this example, the **requests** library):

On Windows:

```
pip install requests
```

On Mac:

```
pip3 install requests
```

## Week 1

[A simple script to retrieve data from a URL](https://github.com/HeardLibrary/digital-scholarship/blob/master/code/api/python/http_request.py) - requires the **requests** library

[Uses the "turtle" drawing tool to make a shape](https://github.com/baskaufs/msc/blob/master/python/turn_right.py)

[Sets up a simple graphical interface with text boxes and a button](https://github.com/HeardLibrary/digital-scholarship/blob/master/code/gui/python/simple_form.py)
