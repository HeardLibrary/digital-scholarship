1\. **Retrieving Tweets from the Twitter API**  The Twitter API requires authentication to retrieve data.  In order to generate the access token that you need in order to use the API, you need to have a Twitter developer account.  If you are in a Python class at Vanderbilt, your teacher will give you a temporary one during the class.  See [this page](../authenticate/) for information on setting up your account, getting the API keys you need to proceed with this problem, and for starter code.

- Modify the example authentication code so that the access token is saved in a file.
- Modify the example API code so that the access token is retrieved from the file above.
- Allow the user to enter the Twitter handle (username) and number of Tweets to be retrieved.
- Hack the [latte maker](https://github.com/HeardLibrary/digital-scholarship/blob/master/code/pylesson/challenge2/latte_maker.py) script, or some other script that uses TkInter to make a graphical interface that allows the user to put the handle and number of tweets in text entry boxes, executes when you click a button, and displays the tweets in a scrolling text box.
