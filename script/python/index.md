# About Python

## Python basics

There are several features of Python that make it extremely popular.  One of the most important is that it is open source.  That means that anyone can download the software necessary to create and run Python programs for free.  

Another consequence of Python's open source status is that versions of Python have been created for most of the common platforms, including PC, Mac, and Linux.  There are also specialized varieties of Python that are designed to run faster, or work better with certain types of data.  So Python is very widely applicable.

A third important feature of Python is that it is relatively simple to learn and use.  Python is a relatively forgiving language that provides you with useful information about the errors that you've made and allows you to easily test your code as you write it.  That makes it very friendly to beginners.

A final significant aspect of Python is that many people have created add-ons, called packages, that can easily be installed to add functionality to the language.  That makes Python extremely versatile.

## Python 2 vs. Python 3

Version 2 of Python has been in wide use for many years.  So although it is no longer in development there is still a large amout of code out in the wild that is written in Python 2.  Since our focus is on helping new users who will primarily be using Python 3 in the future, our focus is on that version of the language.  Fortunately, most Python 3 code will also run as Python 2 (and vice versa) with minimal modification.

# Ways to write and run Python

## Installing a Python distribution

The most basic way to run Python is to install a distribution on your computer, then issue commands one line at a time using the terminal (or "command prompt" on Windows).  [Instructions for installing Python]() (see also the note about Thonny below)

## Using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

An Integrated Development Environment is an auxillary program that makes it easier to write, test, debug, and run a programming language.  An IDE called IDLE is installed automatically when Python is installed.  Another IDE designed specifically for beginners is [Thonny](https://thonny.org/). Installing Thonny also installs Python 3.7 at the same time.  [Instructions for getting started with Thonny]()

## Using a code editor

A code editor is a specialized text editor that comes with tools that make it easier to write code in particular languages.  A very useful feature of a code editor is *syntax highlighting*, a feature that color-codes different elements of the program to make it easier to see the structure of the code and to notice errors.  Some code editors also provide features like error checking and automatic closing of tags like parentheses and quotes.  Two well known code editors suitable for use with Python are **Atom** and **Visual Studio Code**.  If you are a Github user, you may already be using [Atom](https://atom.io/) since it is commonly used to edit Markdown.  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (which is different from Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE) is a very full-featured editor with Python support.  Both Atom and VS Code are free and both have Python plugins to handle Python-specific features.

When writing and testing Python code with a code editor, the code is written in the editor window and run separately by the command line in the terminal/command prompt window.  When a change is made in the editor and saved, re-running the code at the command line shows the effects of the changes that were made.
