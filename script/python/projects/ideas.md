# Generic project ideas

1. Create a game that involves the computer generating a string or numeric value and the user has to guess what it is based on some kind of clues given by the computer.
2. Create a progam the uses information about the time or date to decide on some action determined by user input.
3. Create a program that builds a list based on user input, then manipulates that list in some meaningful way. The user should be able to control the number of items in the list.
4. Create a data dictionary involving some kind of useful information and create a script that allows a user to enter data to discover information based on their input.
5. Create a program that performs some useful or useless task a ridiculous number of times and performs some kind of calculation or manipulation of the data as it loops.
6. Create a program that allows a user to enter a string, then the program manipulates the string in some interesting way based on feedback from the user.
7. Try to write a program that will pass the "Turing Test". Check strings that are input by the user and have the computer respond based on the content of the user's input.

# EES project ideas

## Project learning objectives:

The students will:
- acquire data from a tabular data source and load it into a Python data structure (list of dictionaries).
- extract necessary data from the data structure and wrangle it into a form usable in their analysis.
- use the basic Python structures and statements they have learned: `if`, `for`, `input`, assignment, use a function from a module.
- create a simple visualization using `matplotlib.pyplot`. 

## Project rubric:

| possible points | feature |
| --------------- | ------- |
| 10 | User input with an informative prompt |
| 10 | At least one `if` clause |
| 20 | extract data from, or store data in one or more of the basic Python data structures (list, dictionary, tuple) |
| 10 | a `for` or `while` loop as appropriate for the task |
| 10 | use a function to perform a calculation based on multiple values from the dataset |
| 20 | a visualization using the `matplot.pyplot` module |
| 20 | "does it work" points (i. e. to what extent does the script actually do the required task?) |
