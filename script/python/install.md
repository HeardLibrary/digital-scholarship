# Installing Python

## Before starting

There are [many flavors of Python](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3267976/python/anaconda-cpython-pypy-and-more-know-your-python-distributions.html) and there is no way we could describe how to install all of them.  In the instructions here, we will assume the reference implementation of Python: CPython.  It is the default and most widely used flavor.  

If you think that you are going to want to use the Integrated Development Environment called Thonny, then follow the [Thonny instalation instructions](thonny) instead of these instructions, since Thonny will automatically install CPython as part of its installation.
