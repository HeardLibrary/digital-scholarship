# Getting Started with the Thonny IDE

Thonny is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed to make it easier for beginners to create and run Python Code.  If you install Thonny, it will also install Python 3 if you don't already have it on your system.

Thonny comes pre-installed if you install the Raspbian operating system on a Raspberry Pi computer.

2. A file named something like thonny-3.0.8.dmg will be downloaded to the normal place on your browser.  Here's where it goes on Chrome:

You can now run Thonny by doublc-clicking on it in your Applications folder or by opening it in Launchpad.

5. The first time you open the Thonny application, you may get a message something like the one below:

Click Open.

## Cleanup

1. The .dmg installation file is behaving like a disk drive, so you'll see it on your desktop as a drive icon.  To get rid of it, drag it to the trash can to eject it.

2. Once you've moved the application to your Applications folder, you don't really need the installation file any more.  You can go to your Downloads folder and delete it if you like to keep your Downloads folder uncluttered.
