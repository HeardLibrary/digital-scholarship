# Getting Started with the Thonny IDE

Thonny is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed to make it easier for beginners to create and run Python Code.  If you install Thonny, it will also install Python 3 if you don't already have it on your system.

Thonny comes pre-installed if you install the Raspbian operating system on a Raspberry Pi computer.
