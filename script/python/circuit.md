# DiSC/SEL QT Py Computer Lesson Series: Microcontrollers with CircuitPython

A shortened link to this page is [vanderbi.lt/circuitpython](http://vanderbi.lt/circuitpython).

This lesson series was originally part of an April 2022 in-person workshop sponsored by the [Digital Scholarship and Communications Office (DiSC)](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/) and the [Sarah Shannon Stevenson Science and Engineering Library](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/science/) of the [Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/)..

## About the series

Are you interested in learning how to program a tiny computer to read a sensor? This three-lesson series will teach you how to program a microcontroller (QT Py RP2040) the size of your thumbnail with CircuitPython, and show you how to set up the microcontroller to read sensors in a model rocket!

## Lesson 1 - Microcontroller board and Python background (lesson format)

This first lesson introduces the hardware and CircuitPython, providing a succinct description of the equipment used in the following lessons. This lesson will provide the necessary background information for the minimum coding knowledge youâ€™ll need to start playing with the microcontrollers.

## Lesson 2 - Connecting a microcontroller board and programming with CircuitPython (hands-on format)

The second lesson provides a hands-on introduction to setting up and programming the QT Py RP2040.

## Lesson 3 - Launch a rocket with a microcontroller and record flight data (in-person demonstration)

The third lesson describes how to modify the QT Py RP2040 to run on battery and save data on the onboard 8 MB of memory. In the example, we launched a rocket containing the microcontroller and two sensors to record altitude and motion.
