# R viz using ggplot: Introduction

**Under construction**

This lesson will introduce the conceptual background that influences the construction of ggplot plots. You will practice building several simple [plot types that were previously introduced in the beginner module](../013) using the ggplot function template. 

**Learning objectives** At the end of this lesson, the learner will be able to:
- describe how a ggplot function is constructed from subfunctions.
- compare the structure of ggplot functions to "vanilla" functions built into standard R.
- show how a ggplot subfunction can be "reused" with other subfunctions by assigning it to a variable.
- list two ways that R knows that a ggplot function continues on the next line.
- define *aesthetic* in the context of ggplot.
- describe the variables (type and number) that are suitable for these geoms: `geom_histogram`, `geom_boxplot`, and `geom_point`.
- explain what *global mapping* is and how it affects the arguments passed into various ggplot subfunctions.

# The layered Grammar of Graphics

The "gg" in ggplot stands for "grammar of graphics". In this section we will explore what that means in the context of the ggplot2 R package.

## Introduction (2m 56s)

There are several authoritative resources provided by the creators of ggplot. In this section we will introduce several of them.

## What is a Grammar of Graphics? (4m 41s)

In ggplot, plots are built by adding a series of functions according to a generalized "grammar of graphics" paradigm.

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qwTfuds-3Nw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The functions can include several different plotting functions. If the plot includes multiple geometric features, several *geometric object* functions can be added.


# Common geometric object (geom) types

A particular type of geometric object or *geom* can be plotted by adding its function to the base `ggplot` function. We will see three simple types of geoms here.

## Histogram (3m 30s)

A *histogram* displays the distribution of a single continuous variable.

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RKp-_hz-s24" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Here is an example of code for generating a plot using the histogram geom:

```
ggplot(data = schools_data) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = Female), binwidth = 100)
```

Note that the `ggplot` function is not assigned to anything. So after its "value" is computed, it is displayed (in the `plots` pane). 

## Breaking up ggplot functions onto several lines (2m 40s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SAATn58twIM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It is possible to assign all or part of the function(s) to a variable.

```
base_plot <- ggplot(data = schools_data)
base_plot + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = Female), binwidth = 100)
```

(We see this kind of shortcut in the [ggplot cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf).)

The subfunctions can be put on separate lines, but **only** if there is a trailing plus sign to indicate that another function is coming.

```
ggplot(data = schools_data) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = Female), binwidth = 100)
```

RStudio will auto-indent to show that the functions continue.

## Box and whisker plot (3m 34s)

A *box and whisker* plot compares the distributions of several subsets of the data. The value of `x` is a discontinuous grouping variable. The value of `y` is a continuous numeric variable.

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sGrO3Geg2SY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Unlike the classic R box and whisker plot, ggplot does not care whether the grouping variable is a factor (as it would be if the spreadsheet were read in as a vanilla data frame) or if it is not (if it is read in as a tibble).

```
ggplot(data = human_data) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = grouping, y = height))
```

## Scatterplot with best-fit trendline (4m 00s)

A *scatterplot* plots continuous X and Y variables as a cloud of points. 

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L1oMH9U4d3o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

If only the point geom is added to the plot, only the data points are plotted in the scatterplot.

```
ggplot(data = schools_data) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Limited.English.Proficiency, y = Economically.Disadvantaged))
```

To add a best-fit trendline, it must be added as a separate geom where the points are "smoothed" into a curve. To indicate that the smoothing function is the best fit line, the `method` argument is set to `lm`. This differs from the classic R trendline, which must be added after building a separate linear model for the data.

```
ggplot(data = schools_data) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Limited.English.Proficiency, y = Economically.Disadvantaged)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = Limited.English.Proficiency, y = Economically.Disadvantaged), method = "lm")
```

# Global mapping and cosmetic formatting (4m 02s)

If a mapping aesthetic applies to several geoms, it is annoying and redundant to have to keep repeating the aesthetic.

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/10B_N0HtWeA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

If the aesthetic is mapped within the base `ggplot` function, the aesthetic automatically is mapped to all geoms that are plotted onto that base function. This approach is called *global mapping*. The following example creates the same plot as in the last example, but with more succinct code:

```
ggplot(data = schools_data, mapping = aes(x = Limited.English.Proficiency, y = Economically.Disadvantaged)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

To make the ggplot code easier to read, functions can be broken down across multiple lines.

This example contains exactly the same code as the previous example, but whitespace (newlines and indented spaces) make the structure of the functions more apparent by putting key/value pairs on separate lines. In this case, the open parentheses signals to R that the function is not finished. 

```
ggplot(
  data = schools_data, 
  mapping = aes(
    x = Limited.English.Proficiency, 
    y = Economically.Disadvantaged
    )
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(
    method = "lm"
    )
```

Although highly structured, this representation is also pretty verbose. So you can optimize the structural clarity vs. compactness to create the code you think is most readable.
