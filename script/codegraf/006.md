# Lists and loops

In this lesson we introduce a more complex object: a *list*. A list is a named one-dimensional data structure that allows us to store any number of items and reference them by an *index*. The lesson describes several ways lists are created. It also introduces some ways to manipulate and edit lists. The lesson concludes with two kinds of *loops*, which are ways to step through *iterable* objects like lists or to repeat an action many times.

**Learning objectives** At the end of this lesson, the learner will:
- describe a list object.
- construct a list by specifying its members.
- refer to a list item by its index.
- create lists using functions and methods.
- extract part of a list by slicing.
- randomize or order (alphabetize) a list.
- randomly select an item from a list.
- modify, remove, or add a list item.
- print the items on a list using a `for` loop.
- explain how an *indented code block* is used to define sections of code.
- use a `range()` object to perform action a fixed number of times.
- iterate through a `range()` object using a `for` loop and use the value in a calculation.
- describe how a `while` loop ends when it has an indefinite number of iterations.
- set up a `while` loop to perform actions in an indented code block.
- describe how an empty string can be generated by the enter/return key.
- build a string by repeatedly concatenating additional strings to an empty string.
- build a list by repeatedly appending additional items to an empty list.
- describe the actions that occur when several methods are attached sequentially.

# Lists

## Introduction to lists (5m58s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3-gPTHsYJ0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

A list is a sequence of objects.  The objects may be the same or different, but often are the same.  The order of the list is important and items can be referenced by their position in the list, numbered from zero.  

A list is created by putting the sequence in square brackets, separated by commas.  In the following example, a list is assigned to a variable:

```python
basket = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'lemon', 'lime']
```

To reference a particular item, write the variable name followed by square brackets containing the index (position) of the object in the sequence: `basket[2]`.

To determine the count of items in a list, use the `len()` function.  In this example, it would be `len(basket)`, which would have a value of 5.

## Lists as output of functions (5m44s)

## Slicing a list (5m07s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mGnQCI6RcCk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

A *slice* of the list can be referenced using the following notation: `basket[1:4]`.  **Important note: in Python, when ranges are specified, for some reason, the last number in the range is one greater than the actual position in the range.**  So in this example, items 1 through 3 will be included. Since counting in Python is zero based, that means that the slice will contain the second through fourth items.

Retrieving parts of strings uses the same notation as lists.  (You can essentially think of a string as a list of characters.)  So to get a particular character:

```python
nobelPeacePrize = 'Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld'
print(nobelPeacePrize[2])
```

and to get part of a string, use:

```python
nobelPeacePrize = 'Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld'
print(len(nobelPeacePrize))
print(nobelPeacePrize[12:15])
```

Notice that escaped characters count as a single character even if we write them as an escape sequence using several characters.

## Modifying a list (4m20s)

To add an item to a list, use the `.append()` method.  Here is an example:

```python
basket.append('durian')
```

Notice that there is no assignment with this method -- you simply apply it and the list itself is changed. 

A list can also be empty.  You can create an empty list like this:

```python
hungry = []
```

You can then add items to the list using the `.append()` method. 

To change an item in a list, just assign a new value to that item:

```python
basket[1] = 'tangerine'
```

To remove an item from the list using its value, use the `.remove()` method:

```python
basket.remove('banana')
```

You can also delete an item using its index number:

```python
del basket[3]
```

Two lists can be combined using the `+` operator.

## for loops (5m46s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uAlD1Y5e4Ao" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

A very common task in Python is to repeat some code multiple times.  For example, suppose we want to do something with every item in a list.  A list is *iterable*, meaning that you can step through the list and operate on each of the items in the sequence.  Here's an example:

```
basket = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'lemon', 'lime']
for fruit in basket:
    print('I ate one ' + fruit)
print("I'm full now!")
```

Each time the script iterates to another item in the list, it repeats the indented code block below the `for` statement and the value of the iterator (`fruit` in this case) changes to the next item.  Strings are also iterable:

```
word = 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'
print('Spell it out!')
for letter in word:
    print(letter)
print('That wore me out.')
```

## Iterating over a range object (10m28s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WeoJz01w1ww" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

You can generate an iterable range of numbers using a `range()` object.  The form of the numbers we use in `range()` is similar to the numbering in slices, although we separate them with commas.  The first number is the starting number and the second number is one more than the ending number. An optional third number can specify the step (e.g. 2 would generate every second number).  The step can also be negative.

We can use a `for` statement to iterate through a range.  Here are examples:

```python
for count in range(1,11):
    print(count)
```

```python
print('Prepare to launch!')
for countDown in range(10,0,-1):
    print(countDown)
print('Lift off!')
```

Notice how we need to be careful that our second number goes one step beyond our intended range.  

```python
cheer = ''
for skipper in range(2, 10, 2):
    cheer = cheer + str(skipper) + ', '
cheer = cheer + 'who do we appreciate?'
print(cheer)
```

Notice in this example that if we wanted to treat the integer that we generated as a string, we needed to convert it to a string using the `str()` function. That allows us to do a clever trick of starting the `cheer` object as an empty string, then concatenating more strings to its end each time the code block is executed in the loop.

Ranges are often used to index list items when we want to iterate through a list, but have access to the index number.  Here is an example:

```python
basket = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'lemon', 'lime']
print("Here's a list of the fruit in the basket:")
for fruitNumber in range(0, len(basket)):
    print(str(fruitNumber+1) + ' ' + basket[fruitNumber])
print('You can see that there are ' + str(len(basket)) + ' fruits in the basket.')
```

Notice several things:
1. Because the number of items in the list `len(basket)` (5) is one more than the index of the last item in the list `basket[4]`, the range covers the entire list, since ranges must end one number greater than the range you want.
2. I had to add 1 to the `fruitNumber` as it iterated because Python counts starting from zero and I wanted to start numbering from one.
3. I had to use the `str()` function each time I wanted to concatenate one of the integer numbers to other strings. I also could have printed the numbers by passing them into the `print()` function as several arguments separated by commas. That would not have required converting them from integers to strings.
