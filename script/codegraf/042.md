# GitHub for beginners: Collaborative project management

In this lesson, we delve into the complexities of working with collaborators to manage text-based files. We look at the Kanban-style GitHub Projects board to see how it is integrated with issues and pull requests. We then examine in detail the use of branches and pull requests to allow feature development to happen independently from the main production branch of a repository.

**Learning objectives** At the end of this lesson, the learner will be able to:
- create an automated kanban GitHub project.
- add cards to the project board directly or by tagging existing issues.
- convert a note card to an issue.
- add an existing issue to a project by selecting it using the `Add cards` feature.
- move issues automatically to the `Done` column by closing them.
- add a pull request to the `In progress` column of a project by adding it to the project.
- close a project when it is no longer relevant.
- invite a collaborator to have push access to your repository.
- accept an invitation to collaborate in another user's repository.
- clone a repository to which you have been added as a collaborator.
- create an organization and use it to allow joint ownership of a repository.
- explain the relationship between creating and merging a working branch.
- describe the purpose of a pull request.
- create a working branch using GitHub desktop and publish it to GitHub.
- switch between branches (check out a new branch) using GitHub desktop.
- create a pull request.
- request a review of a pull request.
- carry out a review of a pull request.
- merge a pull request.
- delete a merged branch on GitHub and locally using Desktop.

# Project boards (1m32s)

GitHub includes the capability to create project Kanban boards associated with a repository. These boards use "cards" sorted into columns and are similar to other project management tools like Trello. However, the cards on the board can also be issues or pull requests, so they are integrated with other code management tools that are specific to GitHub.

.

As of 2022-02-29, GitHub has a beta version of projects with several new features. The cards of the project to be viewed and sorted in a tabular form (rather than as a board). The project can also be managed on an organization-wide level, rather than being associated with a particular repository. That allows the board to include issues from the trackers of several repositories.

## Setting up a project (1m47s)

.

When creating a new project, you can select a template for the project.  I recommend "Automated kanban".  It is pre-configured with "to do", "in progress", and "done" columns and uses triggers to automatically move issues and pull requests through the system.

## Creating cards (2m13s)

.

The main component of a GitHub project is a "card".  Cards can be added manually using "Add cards" on the board.  However, they are more often generated automatically by assigning an issue or pull request to the project.  

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-projects/pull-request-to-project.png" style="border:1px solid black">

When the pull request or issue is created, it automatically gets added to the correct column in the project board (`To do` for issues and `In progress` for pull requests).

## Managing the project (2m08s)

.

When a pull request is merged or an issue is closed, its card automatically moves to the "done" column.

Cards can also be manually moved from one column to another and additional columns can be added.

# Working with collaborators and organizations

Inviting collaborators and creating organizations makes it possible for more than one person to contribute to and manage a repository.

## Inviting a collaborator

Find out the username of the person you want to invite to collaborate with you. Either collaborator can set the repo up, but it can only be on one person's GitHub account. 

![alter ego image](../../../manage/control/github/images-collaborate/alter_ego.png)

In this example, I'm going to invite Tomy, my alter ego who uses my test `baskauf` account, to share a repository on my real GitHub account `baskaufs` (with an "s"). Go to a repository you want to share and click on the `Settings` tab.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-collaborate/setting_menu.png" style="border:1px solid black" alt="menu location"/>

Click on the `Manage access` link.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-collaborate/access_link.png" style="border:1px solid black" alt="access link"/>

You may be asked to provide a password to confirm access.  Click on the `Invite a collaborator` button.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-collaborate/invite_button.png" style="border:1px solid black" alt="invite collaborator button"/>

In the popup, start typing the name of the collaborator you want to invite and select it from the list when it appears.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-collaborate/select_collaborator.png" style="border:1px solid black" alt="select collaborator dialog"/>

Click the `Add ...` button.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-collaborate/add_button.png" style="border:1px solid black" alt="add to repo button"/>

You should see them as a pending invitation in the list of collaborators.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-collaborate/pending.png" style="border:1px solid black" alt="pending on list"/>

When Tomy checks his email, he should see an invitation to collaborate and a link.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-collaborate/invite_email.png" style="border:1px solid black" alt="invitation email"/>

Sometimes the email takes too long to arrive, or gets sent to spam. If so, the invited collaborator can speed up the process by attaching `/invitations` to the end of the repository URL. If they are logged into GitHub, they should see their invitation at that link.

Here is what Tomy sees when he goes to that link. 

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-collaborate/invitation_page.png" style="border:1px solid black" alt="invitation page"/>

When he clicks on the `Accept invitation` button, he will be taken to your repository, where he'll see a notification at the top of the screen saying he now has push access to the shared repo.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-collaborate/push_access.png" style="border:1px solid black" alt="push access notification"/>

----

## Accessing the shared repository

Once the collaborator has push access, they can clone it using GitHub Desktop and start using it just as they would one of their own repos.  

To clone the newly shared repository using Desktop, Tomy should drop down the arrow to the right of the current repository name, then drop down `Add`, followed by `Clone Repository...`.  

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-collaborate/repos_to_clone.png" style="border:1px solid black" alt="list of shared repositories to clone"/>

On the GitHub.com tab, he will scroll down past his own repositories until he sees his collaborator's account name. Under that account, he should see the newly shared repository. After he selects it and chooses the location in the directory where he wants it to go, he clicks the `Clone` button and starts using it.


----

## Organizations and teams

Once you embark on collaborative work, you will probably need to set up infrastructure that is not dependent on your personal GitHub account. One key is to set up an organization.  Creating an organization allows repositories to be jointly owned by several people, so if an organizer leaves the organization, that person can be disentangled from the repositories without having to remove material from their personal repository.  

Anyone can create an organization for free.  As of February 2021, free accounts can have unlimited public and private repositories, and unlimited colaborators. There doesn't seem to be a hard limit of size, but less than 5 GB per repository is recommended.  

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-projects/new-organization.png" style="border:1px solid black">

Once you've set up the organization, you can add members, change their status (owner, member, outside collaborator), grant administrative privileges to repos, and establish teams. The ownership of the repository can be granted to other members in the event that the person who created the organization leaves it.  

An advantage of teams is that they can be notified (@mention'ed) as a team rather than individuals, and team members can have conversations that aren't limited to an issue, pull request, project, or repository.  Teams also are a way to control levels of access to particular repositories.  Members of the organization can request to join teams, and their requests can be approved by a team owner or maintainer.  So teams may be a good option for large projects.

# Branches and pull requests (1m58s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3mJ3-OF8700" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Branches

![branches and commits](../branches-diagram.png)

In an earlier lesson, we defined a *branch* as a set of files that changes over time.  A repository can have several branches at the same time and each one is maintained with its own record of commits over time.  

The primary branch of a repository is called the *main* branch.  In a very simple repository, the `main` branch may be the only one.  But more commonly, there are several branches that have been created by *branching* them off of `main`.  ("Branch" is both a noun and a verb in Git.)  When you create a branch from the `main` branch (or some other branch), it begins with exactly the same files as its source.  It also carries the commit record of its "parent" branch as well.  

The purpose of a branch is to allow for the development of documents independently of `main`.  You might choose to create a branch if you want to develop a new feature of software you are developing, or you may create a branch if you are creating a significant revision of a document.  Working in a branch allows you to "take risks" without the danger of possibly messing up the `main` branch. This kind of branch is called a **working branch** or a **feature branch**.

There are several possible fates of a branch.  A common fate for a working branch is for it to be merged back into the `main` branch.  This can happen when the revision is complete, or if the new feature has been debugged and is ready to be deployed.  You might also decide that development of the branch is hopeless, and just delete it and return to `main`.  In some cases, a branch may remain as a separate entity from the `main` branch` with no intention of ever merging it. This is a common practice when using GitHub Pages to manage a website. 

**Historical note:** In the past, the primary branch of a repository was called `master`. In order to foster more inclusive terminology, [as of October 2020](https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-main-starting-next-month/) GitHub has changed the default name for the primary version of repositories from `master` to `main`. However, you will still see some old repositories using `master` for the primary branch as it may be disruptive to change the name of a production branch.

----

## The Shared Repository model

The *[Shared Repository model](https://help.github.com/articles/about-collaborative-development-models/)* is one of the two major ways that development is coordinated in large projects that involve more than a few collaborators.  

![shared repository model diagram](../../../manage/control/github/images-ways/shared-repo-model.png)

In the shared repository model, all collaborators have write access to the repo.  They push changes to the branches they are working on directly to the shared repository. 

This model is common when teams are relatively small, and especially when development is not open to the public.  The other model, [*Fork and Pull*](../../../control/github/fork/) (also known as the **Open Source model*), is common in large, open source projects where features may be created by contributors who aren't on the core team, and therefore don't have write access to the repository. 

![merging a pull request](../../../manage/control/github/images-ways/shared-repo-merge.png)

Individuals can simply merge a feature branch back into the `main` production branch, but if they are working as part of a team, there are usually social conventions governing the circumstances under which a feature branch is merged into `main`. 

Before carrying out a merge, one of the collaborators creates a *pull request*.  A pull request is NOT a request to immediately merge, but rather indicates the beginning of a review and dialog about the proposed changes.  A significant amount of time can elapse between a pull request and a merge, and additional changes may be required on the working branch before its changes are actually ready to be incorporated into the master.  (Note: "pull" in the context of pull requests means to pull changes from a branch into the master.  That's a different process from "pulling" changes from GitHub to a cloned local repository.)

This workflow of branching, pull request, reviewing, and merging is sometimes called [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow). Some version of it is used by many organizations that utilize GitHub.

## Creating a branch (1m33s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DfSS7wep2As" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

. 

**Note:** these screenshots show the old default production branch, `master`. The current default is `main`.

In this example, my coworker has created a repository called `feline-cuisine` and has invited me to be a collaborator.  I have accepted and have cloned the repository to my local computer.  

When I click on the `Current Branch` tab of the desktop client, here's what I see:

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-branch/desktop-branches.png" style="border:1px solid black">

Currently, there is only one branch, `main`,  in the repo.

I want to work on the project, but would prefer to develop my changes on a separate branch.  So I click on the `New Branch` button.  In the resulting popup, I give the branch a descriptive name.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-branch/desktop-enter-branch-title.png" style="border:1px solid black">

Then I click on the Create Branch button.  The GitHub Desktop automatically checks out the new branch and lists it as the current branch.  

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-branch/desktop-current-branch.png" style="border:1px solid black">

Note that at this point the branch only exists on my local copy of the repository. If I want, I can click `Publish branch` and the new branch will be created in GitHub.  Alternatively, I can edit and make commits before pushing the branch.  

## Changing to a preexisting branch

The process of creating a representation of a branch in your local file system from data that git has documented in a repository is called *checking out* that branch.

By default, the desktop client checks out the `main` branch of a newly cloned repo.  However, if that repo has more than one branch, you can change from the master branch to another branch by dropping down the middle "Current Branch" menu at the top of the window.  

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-clone/current-branch.png" style="border:1px solid black">

When you select a different branch in this dialog, the desktop client will check out that branch.

Checking out a branch literally changes the files that are present on your local computer. For example, when I selected the master branch as my current branch, here's what several directories looked like:

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-clone/master-branch-directory.png" style="border:1px solid black">

You can see that the pylesson directory has a lot of files in it and the lod directory doesn't.  If I change to the "gh-pages" branch:

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-clone/change-to-gh-pages.png" style="border:1px solid black">

then I'm checking out a different set of files.  Here's what the directories look like now:

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-clone/gh-pages-branch.png" style="border:1px solid black">

Some files have disappeared, like the ones in the pylesson directory, and other files have appeared in the lod directory.  The content of the files themselves may also change if the state of the files is different in the two branches.  **Note:** Git only manages files, not directories.  When Git checks out a different branch, it doesn't delete directories, even if they don't contain any files in that branch.

![GitHub work cycle](../../../manage/control/github/images-clone/work-cycle.png)

It's important before you start working on files that you are clear what branch you currently have checked out. Recall that the first step in the GitHub work cycle is not only to select the repository you want to work on, but also to make sure that you have checked out the proper branch.

It is also important to make sure that you've saved the files that you were working on before you check out a different branch in the same repository.  It is possible to lose unsaved changes if you don't, although usually the desktop client is smart enough to give you some kind of warning first.

If you switch the GitHub Desktop to another repo, it will remember what branch you were working on the next time you switch back to that repository.

## Creating and reviewing a pull request (4m51s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sSdScWKQxcE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

.

Once I've solved all of the problems I noticed, my changes need to be merged into the `main` branch.  To start that process, I need to create a *pull request* to initiate discussion about my changes.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-branch/pull-request-button.png" style="border:1px solid black">

If I click on the `Code` tab in the online repo.  I see a notification of my recently pushed branch, with an option to open a pull request.  

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-branch/create-favorites-pull-request.png" style="border:1px solid black">

The resulting page has a lot of useful information.  Importantly, there is a list of commits with their corresponding messages.  You can see why it's important to create commit messages that succinctly state what was accomplised with each commit.  Since I've edited Tomy's document, it would be appropriate for me to request that he review the pull request (see the `Reviewers` option in the upper right).  The full set of changes to the file are shown at the bottom of the page -- if I want to see what was done in each commit, I can click on the commit message in the list.  Notice that in the text of my comment, I can refer to an issue by putting its number after a hash mark.  After I click on the `Create pull request` button, Tomy will receive a notification about the review (by email, if his settings allow). 

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-branch/completed-pull-request.png" style="border:1px solid black">

I could merge the pull request myself, but our team has established a policy that merges should always be done by someone other than the creator of the pull request.  

----

## Review and merge

Since my collaborator has his notifications settings set to receive notification emails, he receives two emails.  One notifies him that he has been requested to review and the other is a general summary notification of the pull request:

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-branch/pull-request-email2.png" style="border:1px solid black">

When he clicks on the link in his email to go to the pull request, he sees the review request:

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-branch/review-request-button.png" style="border:1px solid black">

After he clicks the `Add your review` button, he's taken to the review screen where he writes his review and indicates his approval.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-branch/review-screen.png" style="border:1px solid black">

Clicking on the `Submit review` button generates a notification to me that he's reviewed the request and agrees.  After submitting his review, he's taken back to the pull request screen where his review has been added to the history of the request.  

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-branch/ready-to-merge.png" style="border:1px solid black">

If he'd disallowed the merge, he could have closed the pull request without merging.  But instead he clicks the `Merge pull request` button. Confirmation is requested, and after confirming, the `steve-suggestion` branch is merged into the master branch.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-branch/merge-success.png" style="border:1px solid black">

The commits that were made in the `steve-suggestion` branch are now part of the master branch and will appear in its history.  The working branch is no longer needed and can be deleted from the online GitHub repo by clicking the `Delete branch` button.  However, that does NOT delete the branch from any local repositories on the desktop computer.  To delete the unneeded repo from it, go to the `Branch` menu on the desktop client and select `Delete...`.  

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-branch/delete-branch-desktop.png" style="border:1px solid black">

If you hadn't already deleted the branch on GitHub, you could check the box to delete it at the same time. After deleting, the desktop client will automatically switch back to the master branch.  Checking the history tab, we see the commits from the working branch now incorporated into the history of the master.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-branch/master-history-desktop.png" style="border:1px solid black">

----

## Creating a patch branch

Usually, one would develop a document using a working branch on a local computer and manage commits using the desktop client.  However, it's possible to make minor edits using the online editor through a *patch branch*.  The process is similar to what was described above - to see details, go to [this page](../../../manage/control/github/patch/).  That page also shows how to resolve a merge conflict using the online editor.  

----

## Protected branches

The instructions above assume that all collaborators have unrestricted push access to the repository. In order to add a degree of protection to the `main` branch (or any other branch), it can be *protected* by adding additional requirements that make it more difficult to change. For more details, go to [this page](../../../manage/control/github/protected/).
