# Project boards (1m32s)

GitHub includes the capability to create project Kanban boards associated with a repository. These boards use "cards" sorted into columns and are similar to other project management tools like Trello. However, the cards on the board can also be issues or pull requests, so they are integrated with other code management tools that are specific to GitHub.

As of 2022-02-29, GitHub has a beta version of projects with several new features. The cards of the project to be viewed and sorted in a tabular form (rather than as a board). The project can also be managed on an organization-wide level, rather than being associated with a particular repository. That allows the board to include issues from the trackers of several repositories.

## Setting up a project (1m47s)

.

When creating a new project, you can select a template for the project.  I recommend "Automated kanban".  It is pre-configured with "to do", "in progress", and "done" columns and uses triggers to automatically move issues and pull requests through the system.

## Creating cards (2m13s)

.

The main component of a GitHub project is a "card".  Cards can be added manually using "Add cards" on the board.  However, they are more often generated automatically by assigning an issue or pull request to the project.  

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-projects/pull-request-to-project.png" style="border:1px solid black">

When the pull request or issue is created, it automatically gets added to the correct column in the project board (`To do` for issues and `In progress` for pull requests).

## Managing the project (2m08s)

.

When a pull request is merged or an issue is closed, its card automatically moves to the "done" column.

Cards can also be manually moved from one column to another and additional columns can be added.

# Working with collaborators and organizations

Inviting collaborators and creating organizations makes it possible for more than one person to contribute to and manage a repository.

## Inviting a collaborator

Find out the username of the person you want to invite to collaborate with you. Either collaborator can set the repo up, but it can only be on one person's GitHub account. 

![alter ego image](../../../manage/control/github/images-collaborate/alter_ego.png)

In this example, I'm going to invite Tomy, my alter ego who uses my test `baskauf` account, to share a repository on my real GitHub account `baskaufs` (with an "s"). Go to a repository you want to share and click on the `Settings` tab.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-collaborate/setting_menu.png" style="border:1px solid black" alt="menu location"/>

Click on the `Manage access` link.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-collaborate/access_link.png" style="border:1px solid black" alt="access link"/>

You may be asked to provide a password to confirm access.  Click on the `Invite a collaborator` button.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-collaborate/invite_button.png" style="border:1px solid black" alt="invite collaborator button"/>

In the popup, start typing the name of the collaborator you want to invite and select it from the list when it appears.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-collaborate/select_collaborator.png" style="border:1px solid black" alt="select collaborator dialog"/>

Click the `Add ...` button.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-collaborate/add_button.png" style="border:1px solid black" alt="add to repo button"/>

You should see them as a pending invitation in the list of collaborators.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-collaborate/pending.png" style="border:1px solid black" alt="pending on list"/>

When Tomy checks his email, he should see an invitation to collaborate and a link.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-collaborate/invite_email.png" style="border:1px solid black" alt="invitation email"/>

Sometimes the email takes too long to arrive, or gets sent to spam. If so, the invited collaborator can speed up the process by attaching `/invitations` to the end of the repository URL. If they are logged into GitHub, they should see their invitation at that link.

Here is what Tomy sees when he goes to that link. 

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-collaborate/invitation_page.png" style="border:1px solid black" alt="invitation page"/>

When he clicks on the `Accept invitation` button, he will be taken to your repository, where he'll see a notification at the top of the screen saying he now has push access to the shared repo.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-collaborate/push_access.png" style="border:1px solid black" alt="push access notification"/>

## Accessing the shared repository

Once the collaborator has push access, they can clone it using GitHub Desktop and start using it just as they would one of their own repos.  

To clone the newly shared repository using Desktop, Tomy should drop down the arrow to the right of the current repository name, then drop down `Add`, followed by `Clone Repository...`.  

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-collaborate/repos_to_clone.png" style="border:1px solid black" alt="list of shared repositories to clone"/>

On the GitHub.com tab, he will scroll down past his own repositories until he sees his collaborator's account name. Under that account, he should see the newly shared repository. After he selects it and chooses the location in the directory where he wants it to go, he clicks the `Clone` button and starts using it.


## Organizations and teams

Once you embark on collaborative work, you will probably need to set up infrastructure that is not dependent on your personal GitHub account. One key is to set up an organization.  Creating an organization allows repositories to be jointly owned by several people, so if an organizer leaves the organization, that person can be disentangled from the repositories without having to remove material from their personal repository.  

Anyone can create an organization for free.  As of February 2021, free accounts can have unlimited public and private repositories, and unlimited colaborators. There doesn't seem to be a hard limit of size, but less than 5 GB per repository is recommended.  

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-projects/new-organization.png" style="border:1px solid black">

Once you've set up the organization, you can add members, change their status (owner, member, outside collaborator), grant administrative privileges to repos, and establish teams. The ownership of the repository can be granted to other members in the event that the person who created the organization leaves it.  

An advantage of teams is that they can be notified (@mention'ed) as a team rather than individuals, and team members can have conversations that aren't limited to an issue, pull request, project, or repository.  Teams also are a way to control levels of access to particular repositories.  Members of the organization can request to join teams, and their requests can be approved by a team owner or maintainer.  So teams may be a good option for large projects.
