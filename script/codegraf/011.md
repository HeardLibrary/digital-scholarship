# R programming basics: Vectors and vectorized computing

This lesson is focused on the fundamental data structure in R, vectors. The lesson will also cover how to make additional functions available to your environment by loading packages.

**Learning objectives** At the end of this lesson, the learner will:
- list three basic types of data in R and describe how they are written
- create a meaningful object name using snake case
- use the assignment operator `<-` to assign a data value to a named object
- list three ways that functions are made available in R
- load an R script from GitHub
- use the `c()` function to generate a vector and assign it to a named object
- write the expression for a sequence of numbers using the `:` notation
- use a function to determine the length of a vector or type of data containend in a vector
- describe how vectorized computing works when a function or operation is applied to a single vector
- describe how vectorized computing works when a function or operation is applied to two vectors
- load a package by issuing the `library()` command or using the graphical interface
- install a package by issuing the `load.packages()` command or using the graphical interface
