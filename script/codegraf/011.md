# R programming basics: Vectors, vectorized computing, and packages

This lesson is focused on the fundamental data structure in R, vectors. The lesson will also cover how to make additional functions available to your environment by loading packages.

**Learning objectives** At the end of this lesson, the learner will:
- list three basic types of data in R and describe how they are written
- create a meaningful object name using snake case
- use the assignment operator `<-` to assign a data value to a named object
- list three ways that functions are made available in R
- load an R script from GitHub
- use the `c()` function to generate a vector and assign it to a named object
- write the expression for a sequence of numbers using the `:` notation
- use a function to determine the length of a vector or type of data containend in a vector
- describe how vectorized computing works when a function or operation is applied to a single vector
- describe how vectorized computing works when a function or operation is applied to two vectors
- load a package by issuing the `library()` command or using the graphical interface
- install a package by issuing the `load.packages()` command or using the graphical interface

If you are a Vanderbilt user, you should be able to use your VUNet ID and password for free access to O'Reilly for Higher Education resources.  To access them, click [this link](http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/eres?id=1676), then log in.  Sometimes it is necessary to close your browser, or clear your cookies to get access, so if you have problems, you can try that. It is also possible to navigate there by going to <https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/>, select `DATABASES A-Z`, click on `O`, then select `O'Reilly for Higher Education`.

In this lesson, I'll reference some sections of the book, *R Cookbook, 2nd Edition*, which you can find by searching at the O'Reilly sight, or try [this direct link to the book](https://learning-oreilly-com.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu/library/view/r-cookbook-2nd/9781492040675/). The direct links in the text might work, otherwise navigate to the correct section by number.

# Vectors

**Note:** Cmments can be added to R scripts to make them more understandable.  A comment starts with the `#` character and R simply ignores everything on the line after it.  Here's an example:

```
# simple script to demonstrate assignment
x <- c(1,2)  # the "arrow" points to the left to show the direction of the assignment
```

Notice that in R, the assignment operator is `<-`, designed to look like a leftward pointing arrow since the data on the right is passed into the variable on the left. (One can also use the symbol `=` as the assignment operator, but using `<-` is more typical.)

R Cookbook [section 2.5](https://learning-oreilly-com.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu/library/view/r-cookbook-2nd/9781492040675/ch02.html#recipe-id038)

A *vector* is a one-dimensional data structure consisting of items of the same kind. This would be analogous to a column of data in a spreadsheet.  Vectors have a name that is used to refer to that particular instance of a vector.  The individual items in the vector can be referenced using their position in the vector, as shown in the diagram above.  Note: R is "one based", meaning that we start counting items at 1.  This is in contrast to Python, which is "zero based" (counting starts at 0).

We can construct a vector by explicitly entering its values using the `c()` (for "construct") function, like this:

```
animal <- c("frog", "spider", "worm", "bee")
```

The screenshot above shows what happens when we create a vector using RStudio, then display the third item in the vector.

# Practice assignment

In the code that you write, for each object use a meaningful name in "snake case".

1. Create a vector object containing the names of the days of the week.
2. Create a sequence of the numbers for the days of the year (1=the first day, 365=the last day). Assign that sequence of numbers to a vector object.
3. Write the expression for Wednesday using your "day of the week" vector.
4. Create a vector containing numbers from 0 to 100. Each number represents the radius of a circle. Calculate the areas of those circles and assign the answer to another vector. You can use 3.14 as an approximation of `pi`. Note: `/` is the operator for division, `*` is the operator for multiplication, and `^` is the operator for exponentiation (i.e. `r^2` is r squared).
5. The number of dogs in five households is: `2, 0, 1, 0, 1`. The number of cats in the same five households is: `1, 0, 0, 2, 3`. Assign the number of dogs to one vector and the number of cats to another vector. Calculate the number of pets (dogs plus cats) in the five households and assign the answer to another vector.
