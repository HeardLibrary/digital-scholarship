# R programming basics: Vectors, vectorized computing, and packages

This lesson is focused on the fundamental data structure in R, vectors. The lesson will also cover how to make additional functions available to your environment by loading packages.

**Learning objectives** At the end of this lesson, the learner will:
- list three basic types of data in R and describe how they are written
- create a meaningful object name using snake case
- use the assignment operator `<-` to assign a data value to a named object
- list three ways that functions are made available in R
- load an R script from GitHub
- use the `c()` function to generate a vector and assign it to a named object
- write the expression for a sequence of numbers using the `:` notation
- use a function to determine the length of a vector or type of data containend in a vector
- describe how vectorized computing works when a function or operation is applied to a single vector
- describe how vectorized computing works when a function or operation is applied to two vectors
- load a package by issuing the `library()` command or using the graphical interface
- install a package by issuing the `load.packages()` command or using the graphical interface

# Practice assignment

In the code that you write, for each object use a meaningful name in "snake case".

1. Create a vector object containing the names of the days of the week.
2. Create a sequence of the numbers for the days of the year (1=the first day, 365=the last day). Assign that sequence of numbers to a vector object.
3. Write the expression for Wednesday using your "day of the week" vector.
4. Create a vector containing numbers from 0 to 100. Each number represents the radius of a circle. Calculate the areas of those circles and assign the answer to another vector. You can use 3.14 as an approximation of `pi`. Note: `/` is the operator for division, `*` is the operator for multiplication, and `^` is the operator for exponentiation (i.e. `r^2` is r squared).
5. The number of dogs in five households is: `2, 0, 1, 0, 1`. The number of cats in the same five households is: `1, 0, 0, 2, 3`. Assign the number of dogs to one vector and the number of cats to another vector. Calculate the number of pets (dogs plus cats) in the five households and assign the answer to another vector.
