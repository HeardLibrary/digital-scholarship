# GitHub for beginners: Commits

In this lesson, we will make commits directly to a GitHub repository in the cloud, then use a code editor to edit files on the local computer, commit them to the local repository, then push commits to GitHub online.

**Learning objectives** At the end of this lesson, the learner will:
- define *commit*
- describe what a series of commits can tell you about work on a project
- mark up a text document using Markdown to format: headings, italics, bold, bulleted lists, and hyperlinks
- explain how Markdown controls what text is put on a single line and how line breaks are generated
- use the online GitHub editor to edit and commit changes in a text document
- view the commit history of a file in an online GitHub repository
- describe two ways that a code editor is different from a word processor
- list 5 stages in the GitHub work cycle
- compare the commit and push process on the desktop client

Branches are a working version of a project. Commits are snapshots of the history of the branch at a given moment in time.

In a version control system, it is possible to revert to a particular commit of a branch if things go badly. You can also compare the differences between two particular commits to see how the project has changed. That kind of comparison is called a *diff*.

## Markdown (3m22s)

Here is the basic Markdown formatting syntax shown in the examples. Note that inline code is done with a backtick (the key in the far upper left on most U.S. keyboards). It is NOT a single quote.

```
# level 1
## level 2
### level 3

*italics*
**bold**
`inline code`

- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

[link text](http://vanderbi.lt/github)

| header1 | header2 |
| --- | --- |
| row1cell1 | row1cell2 |
| row2cell1 | row2cell2 |
```

Here is what the Markdown above looks like when rendered:

This website is rendered with a *theme*, so the exact appearance may vary somewhat from how it would be rendered elsewhere. For example, the bullets in this theme default to yellow arrows rather than the usual dots. The shading and style of tables also varies.

There are many sources of information about Markdown online. A useful general cheatsheet for GitHub flavored Markdown is [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## Committing online (9m36s)

When using the web editing interface you can make direct commits to a branch in the online repository.  

When you're editing a document in the online editor, you type after clicking the `Edit file` tab.  If you click on the `Preview changes` tab, you can see how your file has changed since the previous commit.  Text that's been removed is shown in red and new text is shown in green.  Each time you make a commit, you are required to enter a commit summary.  Optionally, you can also add more detailed comments.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-intro/make-commit.png" style="border:1px solid black">

Although typing a commit summary is annoying, it is important because it makes it possible to get an overview of how the branch has changed over time.  That's crucial for two reasons. In the unhappy situation where you need to revert back to an earlier commit, it will be the easiest way to find where that commit is. The commit history also allows other collaborators to understand the series of changes you made in a branch when examining a pull request and deciding whether your work should be incorporated in the main branch. (More on pull requests in a future module.)

Once you've made the commit, you'll see a summary of the file contents.  If you click on the `History` button, you can see the history of commits.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-intro/file-summary.png" style="border:1px solid black">

The commit history shows all of the commit summaries for commits that have affected this particular file in the past.  The button to the right of the commit summary allows you to see a "diff" that compares how every file in that commit had changed since the previous commit.

## Code editors (3m42s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cJZxqaTmxwA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

There are many excellent free code editors available that can help you more easily edit documents and scripts in many languages.  Two will be mentioned here: [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (not part of [Microsoftâ€™s Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)).  They are not necessarily better than all the others, but we have experience with them and can recommend them.  Both editors are available for Mac, Windows, and Linux, so if you get used to one, you can continue to use it if you change platforms at some time in the future.

**Syntax highlighting**

All good code editors provide syntax highlighting based on the particular programming language of the file you are editing.  Editors generally figure out the language you are using from the file extension of the file. So for example, if you open a file that has the extension `.py` (the usual file extension for Python scripts), the editor will provide highlighting specifically for Python.  If you open a new file and start typing, the editor will not know what kind of highlighting to use until the first time you save the file.  So usually you will want to save the file with the correct extension as soon as you start writing the code.  

Here's what syntax highlighting looks like in Atom for a Python script:

<img src="../../python/images/atom-highlighting.png" style="border:1px solid black">

Here's what the syntax highlighting looks like for the same script in Visual Studio Code:

<img src="../../python/images/code-highlighting.png" style="border:1px solid black">

**Installing the editors**

To install Visual Studio Code, go to <https://code.visualstudio.com/>.  You browser should detect your operating systme and suggest the correct download for it.

To install Atom, go to <https://atom.io/>.  You browser should detect your operating systme and suggest the correct download for it.

## GitHub work cycle (9m14s)

When you are editing files using GitHub desktop, it is important to have a disciplined work cycle to make sure that your work gets saved to the hub without merge conflicts.

![GitHub work cycle](../../../manage/control/github/images-clone/work-cycle.png)

After you've decided what branch you need to work on, it's very important to make sure at the start that you are working on the most recent version of it by pulling any changes from Github. Click on the Fetch origin button at the upper right of the window.  If there are changes that need to be downloaded, you'll see a small number by a downward pointing arrow.  Click the button (now labeled "Pull origin") again to download those changes.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-clone/download-changes.png" style="border:1px solid black">

If you forget to update your local copy of the branch, you risk creating a conflict, since you may be working on a copy that isn't the most recent one.

**Kinds of files that work well with GitHub version control**

Although you can use GitHub for version control on any type of file, the features of GitHub were designed with maintenance of text files in mind.  If you are editing a simple text file, there is no particularly compelling reason why you can't just do the editing in the browser using the built-in GitHub editor.  However, if you are editing a file that contains markup, such as Markdown or XML, or if you are editing code, it is probably easier to do the editing on your desktop using dedicated editing software.  Examples are [Oxygen](https://www.oxygenxml.com/) for XML and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (not actually part of Microsoft Visual Studio) for editing many kinds of code.  For working with GitHub, there are some advantages to using the Atom editor <https://atom.io/>.  Atom was developed by the GitHub team and has some useful features for working directly with GitHub.  There are a lot of plugins available for Atom that do syntax highlighting for different coding languages, and Atom also has a useful Markdown preview feature (available from the Packages menu).

GitHub works reasonably well for some other types of files like CSV spreadsheets and Jupyter notebooks.  When editing these files, you'll want to use an editor designed specifically for them, such as Open Office or Libre Office for CSV, or Anaconda/Jupyter for Jupyter notebooks. When you look at the raw text of these files, they will be a bit difficult to comprehend, but when they are pushed to GitHub, it is pretty good at displaying them so that they look the way they did in your software (i.e. as a table or notebook).

GitHub does NOT work well for managing documents written with proprietary software like Microsoft Word or Excel, at least when files created in those applications are saved in their native file formats (`.docx` and `.xlsx`).  You can commit and upload the files, but GitHub can't display them and they will be impossible to comprehend in the desktop client preview or on GitHub itself.

**Editing and committing**

To make an edit, navigate to the directory where you checked out the repo.  Open a file, make some edits, then save the file.  

If you click on the Changes tab at the upper left of the GitHub Desktop window, you should see the files that changed since the last update and clicking on a filename will show the kind of changes at the right of the screen (additions in red, deletions in green).  

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-clone/file-changes.png" style="border:1px solid black">

Commit your changes.  You'll then see the new commit in the history and as a change that's ready to push up to GitHub.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-clone/make-commit.png" style="border:1px solid black">

Click on the `Push origin` button to push your changes from the desktop client to GitHub.

# Practice assignment

1. Edit the `README.md` file and make at least one commit using the web editing interface.
2. Examine the commit history using the web interface.
3. Use GitHub Desktop to pull the changes from GitHub (in the cloud) to your local drive. Look at the local repository history and find the commit you made in the cloud.
4. Use your code editor (probably Atom) to make at least one change to the README.md file in the local copy of your repository. View how the page will render using the Markdown preview in your editor. Save that change.
5. In GitHub desktop, commit that change and push the change to GitHub.
6. On the GitHub website, view the changed README.md file in your repository and look for the commit that you made locally by checking the online repository history.
