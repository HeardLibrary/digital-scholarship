**Editing and committing**

To make an edit, navigate to the directory where you checked out the repo.  Open a file, make some edits, then save the file.  

If you click on the Changes tab at the upper left of the GitHub Desktop window, you should see the files that changed since the last update and clicking on a filename will show the kind of changes at the right of the screen (additions in red, deletions in green).

Commit your changes.  You'll then see the new commit in the history and as a change that's ready to push up to GitHub.

Click on the `Push origin` button to push your changes from the desktop client to GitHub.

# Practice assignment

1. Edit the `README.md` file and make at least one commit using the web editing interface.
2. Examine the commit history using the web interface.
3. Use GitHub Desktop to pull the changes from GitHub (in the cloud) to your local drive. Look at the local repository history and find the commit you made in the cloud.
4. Use your code editor (probably Atom) to make at least one change to the README.md file in the local copy of your repository. View how the page will render using the Markdown preview in your editor. Save that change.
5. In GitHub desktop, commit that change and push the change to GitHub.
6. On the GitHub website, view the changed README.md file in your repository and look for the commit that you made locally by checking the online repository history.
