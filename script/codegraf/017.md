# Practice assignment

1. Edit the `README.md` file and make at least one commit using the web editing interface.
2. Examine the commit history using the web interface.
3. Use GitHub Desktop to pull the changes from GitHub (in the cloud) to your local drive. Look at the local repository history and find the commit you made in the cloud.
4. Use your code editor (probably Atom) to make at least one change to the README.md file in the local copy of your repository. View how the page will render using the Markdown preview in your editor. Save that change.
5. In GitHub desktop, commit that change and push the change to GitHub.
6. On the GitHub website, view the changed README.md file in your repository and look for the commit that you made locally by checking the online repository history.
