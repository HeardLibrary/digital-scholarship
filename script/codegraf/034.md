# R viz using ggplot: Statistical functions

ggplot allows you to used built-in statistical capabilities to explore your data without running separate statistical transformations. In this lesson, we will also see how some ggplot functions are actually built from less specific functions by assuming default values for some arguments. 

**Learning objectives** At the end of this lesson, the learner will be able to:
- create a histogram using `geom_hist` and use `bins` and `binwidth` to control granularity.
- plot multiple histograms on the same axes using a discontinous factor as the color aesthetic.
- create alternative views of data distribution using `geom_density` and `geom_qq`.
- view distribution summaries of multiple levels of a factor using `geom_boxplot`, `geom_violin`, and `geom_dotplot`.
- describe how more specific types of plots are related to more general types.
- use an explicit `stat` argument to override the default `stat` for a geom.
- create error bars to illustrate the range of variation on a bar plot.
- use `geom_smooth` to show the trend of scatterplot data.
- control the type of curve fitting using the `method` and `formula` arguments of `geom_smooth`.
- turn standard error ranges on and off using the `se` argument of `geom_smooth`.

# Visualizing distributions

## Histograms

`bins` and `binwidth` can be used to set the granularity of the bins used to block the data.

```
ggplot(usa_hemoglobin, aes(hemoglobin)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1)

ggplot(usa_hemoglobin, aes(hemoglobin)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) # 30 bins is the default
```

If there are multiple levels of a factor in the data, each level can be plotted as a different histogram on the same axes using the `color` aesthetic:

```
ggplot(hemoglobin_frame, aes(hemoglobin)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(color = population), fill = "NA", binwidth = 0.5) # NA makes the bars transparent
```

For larger datasets where the data are smoothly distributed, a density plot may make more sense

```
ggplot(usa_hemoglobin, aes(hemoglobin)) +
  geom_density()
```

In this case, a density plot makes it much easier to visualize the overlapping distributions than the histogram. The `alpha` argument can be used to make the fill partially transparent.

```
ggplot(hemoglobin_frame, aes(hemoglobin)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2, aes(fill = population, color = population))
```

A normal quantile (or "Q-Q") plot makes the similarity and differences among overlapping distributions more apparent, although they are harder to understand.

```
ggplot(hemoglobin_frame, aes(sample = hemoglobin)) + 
  geom_qq(aes(color = population)) +
  stat_qq_line(aes(color = population))
```

## Box plots and variants for comparing distributions

Box plot

```
ggplot(hemoglobin_frame, aes(population, hemoglobin)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

Violin plot

```
ggplot(hemoglobin_frame, aes(population, hemoglobin)) + 
  geom_violin()
```

A dot plot shows the magnitude of the data throughout the distribution, but doesn't work well for large datasets. It's better for small datasets, including those that aren't smoothly distributed.

```
ggplot(hemoglobin_frame, aes(x = population, y = hemoglobin)) + 
  geom_dotplot(binaxis = "y", stackdir = "center", dotsize = .5, binwidth = .25, aes(color = population, fill = population))
```

In this example, the distributions are displayed vertically. Reversing the axes will display them horizontally.

# Geom types and the stat argument

In the overall scheme of plot construction, there is a stage where statistics can be applied to data prior to plotting.

We'll explore that stage in this section.

## General and specific geoms

ggplot simplifies the specification of geoms by providing more specific "shortcut" geoms that don't require you to specify all of the arguments.

The most general geom is `layer`, which can be used to build many different kings of geoms by specifying all of the details.

```
ggplot(erg_mean_frame, aes(x=color, y=mean_response)) +
  layer(
    mapping = NULL, 
    data = NULL,
    geom = "bar", 
    stat = "identity",
    position = "identity"
  )
```

The `geom_bar` geom is more specific by hard coding the geom to `bar`. This makes it easier to use because fewer arguments need to be provided. The following plot is exactly the same as the one above.

```
ggplot(erg_mean_frame, aes(x=color, y=mean_response)) +
  geom_bar(
    stat="identity"
  ) 
```

The `stat` argument specifies what kind of statistical transformation is done to the data prior to plotting. A value of "identity" tells the geom to use the data directly without any transformation.

The `geom_col` geom is identical to the `geom_bar` geom, except that the stat always defaults to "identity" and doesn't need to be specified. The following plot will be exactly the same as the two above.

```
ggplot(erg_mean_frame, aes(x=color, y=mean_response)) +
  geom_col(
  )
```

## The stat argument

A `stat` argument can be used to override the default stat for a geom. The default stat for `geom_bar` is "count", but in this example, the y values are derived from a statistical summary of the data rather than the count of items.

```
ggplot(erg_frame, aes(x = color, y = response)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean") # stat = "summary" overrides the default counting method
```

# Error bars

Error bars are create using `geom_errorbar`. They can be applied as a layer on top of bar or point plots.

```
ggplot(graphing_data, aes(x=color, y=mean)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", aes(fill = color)) + # same as geom_col(aes(fill = color))
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean-SE, ymax=mean+SE),
                width=.2)
```

# Statistically calculated line geoms

The `geom_smooth` geom will perform various types of statistical analyses on X-Y data to show the trend in the data. By default, the "loess" stat is used.

```
ggplot(lion_noses, mapping = aes(x = proportionBlack, y = ageInYears)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

By default, standard error ranges are shown around the trend curve. They can be suppressed by providing a `FALSE` value for the `se` argument.

```
ggplot(lion_noses, mapping = aes(x = proportionBlack, y = ageInYears)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

Other statistical methods than loess can be specified. Linear model (`method = "lm"`) will default to the best fit line:

```
ggplot(lion_noses, mapping = aes(x = proportionBlack, y = ageInYears)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

Other functions can be used for the linear model if specified using the `formula` argument

```
ggplot(lion_noses, mapping = aes(x = proportionBlack, y = ageInYears)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ exp(x)) +
  labs(y="age (years)", x = "proportion black")
```
