# The GitHub issues tracker

The issues tracker is a way to keep up with very particular problems associated with a project.  They may be associated with a particular document or may be a general, overarching problem.

.

To create a new issue within a particular repo, click the issues tab.  You'll see the list of existing open issues (if any).  To create a new issue, click on the `New issue` button.

Enter a title for the issue and write text explaining the issue in the box. You can use any of the typical Markdown text enhancements, including hyperlinking using this format:

```
Comment with [link text](http://url.goes.here/) to create a hyperlink.
```

You can use the preview tab to see how it will look.  Here's how the final rendered version looks.

You can also embed images by dragging and dropping them from a file explorer/finder window into the box. The image will automatically be uploaded and embedded in the comment.

## Commenting on and linking issues (1m54s)

.

You can cross-reference other issues by typing the issue number after a hash (`#`) character.  

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-projects/mention-issue.png" style="border:1px solid black">

In the rendered comment, you can mouse over the linked issue to see the details.  

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-projects/view-related-issue.png" style="border:1px solid black">

The reference to the issue also shows up in the record of the referenced issue.  


## Alerting collaborators

You  can use the *@mention system* to make sure that relevant people are informed about the issue.  In a comment on an issue or pull request, if you type the `@` symbol followed immediately by a user or team's GitHub username, a notification will be generated addressed to that user.  If the user has enabled email notifications, he or she will get an email containing the text of the comment and a link that will jump the user directly to the comment or pull request page.  

If you want to assign the issue to some particular collaborator, clicking on the Assignees item will give a dropdown list of possibilities.
