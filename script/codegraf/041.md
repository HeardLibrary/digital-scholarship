# The GitHub issues tracker

The issues tracker is a way to keep up with very particular problems associated with a project.  They may be associated with a particular document or may be a general, overarching problem.

## Introduction (1m10s)

## Creating a GitHub issue (3m12s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VOEexPDwCJM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

.

To create a new issue within a particular repo, click the issues tab.  You'll see the list of existing open issues (if any).  To create a new issue, click on the `New issue` button.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-projects/issues-list.png" style="border:1px solid black">

Enter a title for the issue and write text explaining the issue in the box. You can use any of the typical Markdown text enhancements, including hyperlinking using this format:

```
Comment with [link text](http://url.goes.here/) to create a hyperlink.
```

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-projects/link-in-comment.png" style="border:1px solid black">

You can use the preview tab to see how it will look.  Here's how the final rendered version looks.

You can also embed images by dragging and dropping them from a file explorer/finder window into the box. The image will automatically be uploaded and embedded in the comment.

## Commenting on and linking issues (1m54s)

.

You can cross-reference other issues by typing the issue number after a hash (`#`) character.  

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-projects/mention-issue.png" style="border:1px solid black">

In the rendered comment, you can mouse over the linked issue to see the details.  

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-projects/view-related-issue.png" style="border:1px solid black">

The reference to the issue also shows up in the record of the referenced issue.

## Alerting collaborators (2m13s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8YSuJXXEfJs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

.

You can use the *@mention system* to make sure that relevant people are informed about the issue.  In a comment on an issue or pull request, if you type the `@` symbol followed immediately by a user or team's GitHub username, a notification will be generated addressed to that user.  

<img src="../at_mention.png" style="border:1px solid black">

If the user has enabled email notifications, he or she will get an email containing the text of the comment and a link that will jump the user directly to the comment. There is also a link that will take the reader directly to the issue page on GitHub for additional responses.  Responding to the email automatically adds the response as a comment to the issue thread.  

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-projects/email-meeting.png" style="border:1px solid black">

If you want to assign the issue to some particular collaborator, clicking on the Assignees link will give a dropdown list of possibile names.

## Labeling issues (1m51s)

.

It's also a good thing to assign a *label* to the project.  Labels are like tags in other systems.  Assigning a label categorizes the issues so they can be searched.  It's also a very visual way to know the status and category of an issue and shows up in the issues list.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-projects/start-issue.png" style="border:1px solid black">

When you click on the Label item and a dropdown of possible labels appears.  You can select one of the labels or click on the Edit icon to create a new label.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-projects/select-label.png" style="border:1px solid black">

We don't see the label we need, so click on the `New label` button.  You can select the name, description, and color you want, then click on the `Create label` button.  

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-projects/new-label.png" style="border:1px solid black">

Once the label is created, you can select it and any other labels you want to apply.

## Closing an issue (2m09s)

.

When an issue is resolved, it can be closed directly by clicking the `Close issue` (or `Close with comment`) button. 

You can also close the issue by including certain keywords in the text of either the commit message ("Summary") or the optional detailed "Description". The keywords are `close`, `closes`, `closed`, `fixes`, or `fixed`. In the issue comments, this action will show up along with a link to the commit. Mousing over the commit link will show the summary and description from the commit message.
