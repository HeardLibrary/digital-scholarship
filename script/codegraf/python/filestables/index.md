# Files and tables in Python module

This module shows how to load data from and save data to a local file or file in Google Drive as well as how to retrieve data on the web. It discusses how simple Python data structures like lists and dictionaries can be combined to create tabular data structures. It also introduces a workhorse two-dimensional data structure used in data science with Python: pandas DataFrames. 

This module includes an optional lesson that introduces another commonly used Python multidimensional data structure: NumPy arrays.

**Recommended reference:** Python for Data Analysis, 2nd Edition by Wes McKinney [via Vanderbilt's catalog](https://catalog.library.vanderbilt.edu/permalink/01VAN_INST/6ll2l/alma991043601866403276) / [direct link to O'Reilly (VUNet login required)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653/). [Free online version of documentation via pandas website](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

Total video time: 5h 25m for all parts, but most users will spend about 4h
