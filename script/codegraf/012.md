# R programming basics: Lists, data frames, and tibbles

This lesson is focused on another important data structure in R, data frames. It shows how the structure of data frames are related to the simpler R data structures, vectors and lists. It also introduces a variation on the traditional data frame: tibbles.

**Learning objectives** At the end of this lesson, the learner will be able to:
- create a list using the `list()` function.
- reference a list item using its name or index number.
- create a data frame from equal length vectors using the `data.frame()` function.
- refer to a column of a data frame using the `$` notation.
- refer to a cell in a data frame by its row and column index or by its row name and row position.
- load a CSV file from a path, file-choosing dialog, or URL.
- view the first 6 or last 6 rows of a data frame using `head()` and `tail()`.
- load an Excel file from you computer's hard drive.
- load a CSV or TSV file into a tibble.
- perform a one-vector operation on the column of a data frame.
- perform a two-vector operation on two columns of a data frame.

# Practice assignment

1. Use the code in the lesson script to load the Nashville schools data. What is the difference between how `read.csv()` (regular data frame) and `read_csv()` (tibble) treat spaces in column headers?
2. Display the values in the zip code column
3. How many values are there in the zip code column?
4. Calculate the total number of students in each school by adding the values in the male and female columns
5. Calculate the fraction of students that are white in each school
6. Try to load into a data frame some Excel file that you have on your local drive using the `read.xlsx()` function.
