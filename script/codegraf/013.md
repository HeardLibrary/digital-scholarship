# R programming basics: Basic statistics, plots, and missing data

In this lesson, we will start using R data structures to do simple forms of data exploration through statistical calculations and plotting. In the process, we will learn the role that missing data plays in R data sets. We will also examine how the vectorized programming approach that is fundamental to R influences the way we code complex operations.

**Learning objectives** At the end of this lesson, the learner will be able to:
- describe the function that the missing data indicator `NA` serves in R data structures.
- list two types of cells in CSV files that might be interpreted as `NA` when loaded into an R data frame.
- calculate basic statistics on a vector: `length()`, `mean()`, `sd()`, `summary()`, and `quantile()`.
- describe how the procedural and vectorized programming paradigms differ.
- use the `is.na()` function to modify items in a vector or column of a data frame.
- create a histogram with `hist()`.
- create a box-and-whisker plot using `plot()`.
- create an x-y scatterplot using `plot()`.
- use the `lm()` function to generate a trendline for a scatterplot and to calculate statistical quantities related to linear regressions.

## Standard graphics

The **graphics** package is included in the standard distribution, so many kinds of plots can be generated without installing any additional packages.  A standard reference book for R graphics is *R Graphics* by Paul Murrel (now in its third edition).  The book is available in print from online sellers, but some parts of older editions are available online, such as [chapters 1, 4, and 5 of the first edition](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/RGraphics/RGraphicsChapters-1-4-5.pdf).  There are also [graph galleries for the figures in each chapter of the book](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/RG2e/) that provide the code used to generate the plots.  

Another more brief reference is Chapter 10 of *R Cookbook, 2nd Edition* by Paul Teetor (print book), which shows how to generate many of the typical kinds of simple plots useful to R users. Vanderbilt users can find it by logging directly into the O'Reilly website, using VUNet ID and password at [this link](http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/eres?id=1676). You can also try [this direct link to the book](https://learning-oreilly-com.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu/library/view/r-cookbook-2nd/9781492040675/).

## Basic statistics

R Cookbook [chapter 9](https://learning-oreilly-com.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu/library/view/r-cookbook-2nd/9781492040675/ch09.html#GeneralStatistics) provides a brief introduction to statistical calculations. Because R was created to do stats, there are many, many references available. Some free online resources to get you started are [here](https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/script/r/next/#statistical-analysis-with-r).
