# R programming basics: Basic statistics, plots, and missing data

In this lesson, we will start using R data structures to do simple forms of data exploration through statistical calculations and plotting. In the process, we will learn the role that missing data plays in R data sets. We will also examine how the vectorized programming approach that is fundamental to R influences the way we code complex operations.

**Learning objectives** At the end of this lesson, the learner will be able to:
- describe the function that the missing data indicator `NA` serves in R data structures.
- list two types of cells in CSV files that might be interpreted as `NA` when loaded into an R data frame.
- calculate basic statistics on a vector: `length()`, `mean()`, `sd()`, `summary()`, and `quantile()`.
- describe how the procedural and vectorized programming paradigms differ.
- use the `is.na()` function to modify items in a vector or column of a data frame.
- create a histogram with `hist()`.
- create a box-and-whisker plot using `plot()`.
- create an x-y scatterplot using `plot()`.
- use the `lm()` function to generate a trendline for a scatterplot and to calculate statistical quantities related to linear regressions.

## Standard graphics

The **graphics** package is included in the standard distribution, so many kinds of plots can be generated without installing any additional packages.  A standard reference book for R graphics is *R Graphics* by Paul Murrel (now in its third edition).  The book is available in print from online sellers, but some parts of older editions are available online, such as [chapters 1, 4, and 5 of the first edition](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/RGraphics/RGraphicsChapters-1-4-5.pdf).  There are also [graph galleries for the figures in each chapter of the book](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/RG2e/) that provide the code used to generate the plots. The second edition of *R Graphics* is available online to Vanderbilt users through our O'Reilly subscription. See the following paragraph for login information.

Another more brief reference is Chapter 10 of *R Cookbook, 2nd Edition* by Paul Teetor (print book), which shows how to generate many of the typical kinds of simple plots useful to R users. Vanderbilt users can find it by logging directly into the O'Reilly website, using VUNet ID and password at [this link](http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/eres?id=1676).

## Basic statistics

R Cookbook [chapter 9](https://learning-oreilly-com.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu/library/view/r-cookbook-2nd/9781492040675/ch09.html#GeneralStatistics) provides a brief introduction to statistical calculations. Because R was created to do stats, there are many, many references available. Some free online resources to get you started are [here](https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/script/r/next/#statistical-analysis-with-r).

## Introduction (1m04s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lQozOTrEwEU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

# Missing data

## The missing data indicator NA (3m54s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yOEAAFbjehY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The "not available" missing data indicator `NA` is written without quotes:

```
vector_with_missing <- c(1, 2, NA, 3)
```

Functions that will not return a value when data are missing can be forced to remove `NA` prior to calculating with `na.rm = TRUE`:

```
mean(vector_with_missing, na.rm = TRUE) # remove NAs, then calculate
```

----

## Missing data when reading from CSV files (9m16s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N4tJtJSoTh0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

`read_csv()` converts `""` (empty) and `"NA"` strings to `NA` missing data values when reading CSV data into tibbles.

The behavior of `read.csv()` is complicated with respect to the cells it treats as missing data when it reads values into traditional data frames. Specific strings can be specified to be considered missing data using an `na.strings` argument:

```
data_frame <- read.csv(url, na.strings = c("-9999", "NaN", "NA" ,"")) # all listed strings read as NA
```

A `colClasses = "character"` argument causes every value (including numbers) to be read as characters except for the string `"NA"`, which is still read as an `NA` value.

```
data_frame <- read.csv(url, colClasses = "character")
```

# Basic statistical quantites

## Calculating some statical quantities (7m27s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nv3Tq_ki8HY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

```
length(vector) # returns the number of items in a vector
mean(vector) # returns the average (mean) of items in a vector
sd(vector) # returns the standard deviation of items in a vector
summary(vector) # summaries limits, mean, median, etc. of items in a vector
quantile(vector) # defaults to returning quartiles of a vector
```

To generate quantiles other than quartiles, use the `probs` argument. For example:

```
quantile(x, probs = seq(0, 1, 1/10)) 
```

will generate deciles.

# Procedural vs. vectorized programming paradigm

## Procedural vs. vectorized approaches (4m40s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y_rNZ_KQpKo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## The is.na() function (0m47s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i3VqjttEE14" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The `is.na()` function returns a boolean: `TRUE` if the argument is `NA` and `FALSE` otherwise.

```
is.na(NA) # returns TRUE
is.na(3) # returns FALSE
```

----

## Replacing NA with zeros (9m53s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8jsL9o3c6MQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[Code for Python example](https://gist.github.com/baskaufs/d7a85bbe23b39b3276b5b888c5493ad8)

Example with result in a separate vector:

```
schools_data <- read_csv("https://github.com/HeardLibrary/digital-scholarship/raw/master/data/gis/wg/Metro_Nashville_Schools.csv")
asian <- schools_data$Asian # Asian column of data frame assigned to a named vector object
booleans_vector <- is.na(asian)
asian[booleans_vector] <- 0
mean(asian)
```

Example with replacement in the original column ("in place"):

```
schools_data <- read_csv("https://github.com/HeardLibrary/digital-scholarship/raw/master/data/gis/wg/Metro_Nashville_Schools.csv")
schools_data$Asian[is.na(schools_data$Asian)] <- 0
mean(schools_data$Asian)
```

# Basic plots

## Histograms (3m23s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nR1Sm99vTwE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

```
hist(vector)
```

----

## Box-and-whisker plot (2m34s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lC3Pj_jhjIc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

A box-and-whisker plot is generated when the independent variable (x) is a discontinuous factor and the dependent variable (y) is continous (a numeric vector):

```
plot(y ~ x)
```

Character columns are automatically converted to factors when CSV files are read into traditional data frames using `read.csv()`. They are not converted when CSV files are read into tibbles using `read_csv()`.

----

## Scatterplot with trendline (3m46s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_xLWg_LYSYY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

An X-Y scatterplot is generated when the independent variable (x) and the dependent variable (y) are both continuous (numeric vectors):

```
plot(y ~ x)
```

To include a trend line, a linear model must be generated using the same variables:

```
model <- lm(y ~ x)
```

To overlay the trendline:

```
abline(model)
```

The model will provide information about the linear regression test:

```
model # gives slope and intercept of best-fit line
summary(model) # gives statistical quantities related to the regression
```

# Practice assignment

1. We are going to continue with where we left off in last lesson's practice assignment. Load the Nashville schools data. Again, create a vector that contains the total number of students in the schools by adding the male and female columns. Calculate the fraction of students that are economically disadvantaged. Compare a histogram of the number of students who are economically disadvantaged in each school with a historgram of the fraction of students who are economically disadvantaged. How are the two histograms different?

2. Look at the data table [here](https://github.com/HeardLibrary/digital-scholarship/blob/master/data/gis/wg/Metro_Nashville_Schools.csv). Some of the schools have blank cells for limited English proficiency. Should we should assume that those schools have values of zero or that the empty cells represent missing data? If you think they should be zeros, fix that before you analyze the data. Calculate the fraction of the students who have limited English proficiency. Create a scatterplot of fraction economically disadvantaged (y) vs. fraction limited English proficiency (x).

3. Generate a linear model of fraction economically disadvantaged (y) vs. fraction limited English proficiency (x) and superimpose a trendline on top of your scatterplot from 2. Generate the summary statistics for this linear regression. Statistical notes: This is a better analysis than what I did with the totals in the video because the totals data were not normally distributed. However, there is also somewhat of an implicit assumption when you do a regression that y depends on x. Is that a safe assumption in this case?

4. The World Bank has assembled data on World Development Indicators.  We will examine some data on Women and Development downloaded from their Data Catalog at http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/WV.5 A downloaded Excel file is archived at https://github.com/HeardLibrary/digital-scholarship/blob/master/data/r/WV.5_Women_and_Development.xlsx . The Excel file has a lot of extraneous rows that would not read into R, so the data have been cleaned up a little in this CSV: <https://gist.github.com/baskaufs/510972a23e3153edc133e33a2fcdf3d1>. Notice the non-standard missing data indicator `..`. Click on the Raw button to get the URL of the raw CSV data and use that URL to load the data as a normal data frame using `read.csv()`. Use the `na.strings` attribute to convert cells containing the character string `".."` into R's `NA` missing data indicator.

5. Notice that the data frame contains 12 lines at the end that are summary data and not data about individual countries. We do not want to include those lines when doing a country-by-country analysis. Create a vector that contains the 2017 female life expectancy at birth for all of the countries, but not the summary rows. Calculate the average of the country-by-country life expactancy. Is your answer the same as the average for the World given at the end of the table? Should it be? Why or why not?

6. Using the "nondiscrimination clause mentions gender in the constitution" column as a discontinuous factor for x and percentage of women ages 20-24 first married by age 18 as a continuous factor for y, generate a box-and-whisker plot. Is there a difference between countries that mention gener in a nondiscrimination clause in their constitution and those that do not? Don't forget about excluding the lines at the bottom!

7. Create an x-y scatterplot visualizing the relationship between female financial account ownership and percentage of seats in parliaments held by women. The summary of the model may help interpret the nature of the relationship, if any.
