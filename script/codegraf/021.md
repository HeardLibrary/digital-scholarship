# Complex data structures and functions

In this lesson we will combine two basic Python data structures, lists and dictionaries, to create two dimensional data structures that can be used to store tabular data. We will see how nested for loops can be used to access all of the data in those tables. We will also learn how to make blocks of code reusable by creating our own functions.

**Learning objectives** At the end of this lesson, the learner will be able to:

# Practice exercises

1. **Dealing cards** Here is some code that generates a deck of cards as a list:

The code after the makeDeck() function shows how the choice() function and the .shuffle() method can be used to randomize the cards in the deck.

a. Use this function to write a script that “deals” a five card poker hand by printing five random cards from the deck. Note that after each card is printed, it has to be removed from the deck so that when the next card is printed, there isn’t any chance that you’ll get the same one a second time.

b. Instead of just printing the five cards, use .append() to add them to another list called hand. Print the whole hand list.

c. Can you figure out how to check for any kind of poker hands? How about a flush?




3. **Latte maker**  Create the latte-making function `makeLatte(beans, milk, extras, water)` described earlier in the exercise.  The function will need to have some complicated `if` statements to check for the kinds of beans, milk, and extras.  You should consider whether you should create additional functions that would be called by the `makeLatte()` function to figure out things about the possible ingredients.  Here are the program parameters:

**Minimum inputs** (you can have more):

| variable | possible string values |
|---|---|
| beans | "decaf", "regular", "dark roast" |
| milk | "whole", "skim", "soy" |
| extras | "none", "pumpkin spice", "vanilla" |
| water | "yes", "no" |

**Required output**:

Print a single string formed by concatenating adjective strings in front of the string "latte".  You can use whatever adjectives you think would work best for marketing, but at a minimum, you should be able to produce "regular non-fat plain latte", "decaf skinny vanilla latte", and "dark fat pumpkin spice latte" (substitute a different adjective for "fat" if you can think of a better euphamism).  If "no" is selected for water, then provide some kind of error message.
