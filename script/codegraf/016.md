# GitHub for beginners: Setup

This lesson demonstrates how to set up a GitHub repository and clone it to a local computer using GitHub Desktop Client.

**Learning objectives** At the end of this lesson, the learner will:
- set up a GitHub account on the GitHub website
- create a repository
- describe the purpose of README.md
- install the GitHub Desktop Client
- clone a repository to a local drive using the Desktop Client

Total video time: 15 m 39 s

## Setting up a GitHub account and creating a repository (6m28s)

Once you have an account you can create a new repository through the `+` menu in the upper right of the screen.

In the create repository dialog, you have several choices.  The most important is whether you want the repo to be public or not.  There are also three special files that can live in the root directory of the repository.  One is the .gitignore file. A .gitignore file is not required, but if you are using a coding platform that generates a lot of annoying extraneous files that you don't want to archive in GitHub, you can select a template .gitignore file for that platform that will ignore typical annoying files.

If your repository is public, you should add a license file that is appropriate for the kind of content you will create in the repository.  If you are creating code and you want it to be open, many people use the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).  You can pick it or any other license from the dropdown list.  If you are creating textual content that you want to be usable by anyone, but with attribution, a [Creative Commons Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) (CC BY) license is commonly used. It is not on the dropdown list, but the license file can be copied from [here](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/blob/master/LICENSE).

The third special file is called `README.md`.  When a repository or directory within a repository has a README.md file, it will automatically display when the repository or directory is opened on the GitHub website.  So it's an important way to let potential users know the purpose of the files in that directory.  When you've set up everything, click on the `Create repository` button.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-intro/create-repo.png" style="border:1px solid black">

After you have created the repository (or clicked on a repository name in the repository list for your account), you'll see the list of files in the repository.  If you created a README.md page, it will also be displayed at the bottom of the page.  To create a new file using the online file editor, click the `Create new file` button.  You'll be at the same screen if you click on a file name, then click on the pencil icon at the upper right.

## Cloning a repository (6m38s)

You can initiate cloning of a repository from the website by clicking on the `Clone or download` button in the upper right of the repo page on the GitHub website. If you choose `Open in Desktop`, the repository will open in the GitHub Desktop software after it downloads.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-clone/clone-from-github.png" style="border:1px solid black">

You can also initiate the cloning process from your local computer from within the GitHub Desktop application.  The process described here will work for cloning one of your own repositories, a repository that you've forked to your account from elsewhere, or another repository that you don't own, but to which you have been given write access.

Drop down the Current Repository menu in the upper left of the window.  Click on the Add dropdown and select "Clone Repository...".

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-clone/desktop-clone-option.png" style="border:1px solid black">

You'll be presented with a list of repositories at Github.com to which you have access.  Repos that you own or to which you have write access will show up with little book icons.  Repos that are forks you've made of some other user's repo will have a little "fork" symbol.  Click on the name of the repo you want to clone and you'll have an opportunity to select the directory where you want the local copy of the repo to live on your computer.  Once you've selected a location, the desktop client will default to that location the next time you clone.

<img src="../../../manage/control/github/images-clone/desktop-clone-location.png" style="border:1px solid black">

After you've finished the cloning process, in the left column of the client, you'll see either changed files or the commit history, depending on which tab you've selected.  The second column ("Current Branch") will normally be set at "master" unless you have created another branch.

# Practice assignment

1. Create an online GitHub repository. Select a license, `.gitignore`, and generate a `README.md` file.
2. Clone that repository to your local computer's drive using GitHub Desktop. Be thoughtful about where you want the repository to go on your local computer drive because it will be harder to change the default location later.
3. Using your system's file directory application (Finder on Mac, File Explorer on Windows), navigate to the repository directory. See if you can figure out a way to open the `README.md` file, but don't worry if you can't (we will do that in the next lesson).
