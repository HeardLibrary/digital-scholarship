# Set up CircuitPython

<br/>
## Download CircuitPython

In this step, we'll install the "operating system" (i.e., CircuitPython) for the board (i.e., QT Py RP2040) into your computer

1\. **Open [https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_qtpy_rp2040/](https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_qtpy_rp2040/)** link. **ALERT:** DO NOT open the file after you download it.

2\. **Download** the **latest stable** release of CircuitPython **.UF2 file** (i.e., <span style="color:purple">purple</span> "DOWNLOAD .UF2 NOW") for the QT Py RP2040 

3\. **Save** the file **in a secure and accessible location** in your computer.

<br/>
## Connect the board

In this step, we'll be connecting the QT Py RP2040 microcontroller board to your computer with a usb cable

1\. **Connect** the **type-c** end of a USB cable **to** the QT Py RP2040 **board**. **ALERT:** *DO NOT* connect the board to your computer, yet
* Below there is a diagram of the QT Py RP2040 board with a <span style="color:red">red</span> square/border around a button. 
* **remember** where the <span style="color:red">red</span> **"button"** is, also known as the boot button.

<img src="../images/circuit_python_instruction_images_videos/qtpy_boot_button_2.png" title="QT Py Diagram" style="border:1px solid black" width="348" height="282">

2\. **While holding onto the** <span style="color:red">red</span> **"button,"** located in the center, **connect** the other end of **the usb cable to your computer**. After connecting to your computer you can stop holding onto the button.
* *Notice:* this process is similar to connecting an **external drive** (e.g., usb drive). 

3\. To verify if your device recognized the QT Py board, **view the "drive" in your file explorer**. It'll be **named "RPI-RP2."** 
* Reminder: think of the board as the hardware (i.e., computer) and the .UF2 file as the "operating system" (e.g., Windows 10, OS X, etc.) necessary for the board to run.

<br/>
## Copy CircuitPython to the board 

In this step, we'll be connecting the "operating system" (i.e., .UF2 file) and the board (i.e., QT Py RP2040) 

1\. Open your file explorer and locate where the .UF2 file you downloaded in the "Download CircuitPython" step

2\. **Copy and paste** the "operating system" (i.e., **.UF2 file**) **into the external drive** (i.e., RPI-RP2) you connected in the "Connect the board" step
* *Notice:* if you need help finding where they are, ask someone for help
* if **done successfully**, the **external drive** is **renamed** to **"CIRCUITPY."**

<br/>
## Install the Mu code editor

In this step, we'll install a code editor (i.e., [Mu editor](https://codewith.mu/en/about)) 

1\. **Open [https://codewith.mu/en/download](https://codewith.mu/en/download) link**  

2\. Select your operating system (i.e., Windows or Mac OSX) and start to **download** the **Mu Editor** **in a secure and accessible location** in your computer
* *Notice*: Ask for help if you cant download Mu Editor. A "Mu Editor isn't commonly downloaded" warning might appear for some computers. You need to specify that you trust Mu Editor, "keep anyway," and proceed downloading the editor.

3\. Navigate to the location of the Mu Editor in your File Explorer and proceed to **install** the **Mu Editor**, this might take a few minutes (e.g., ~5 min). 
* *Notice*: Mu Editor will attempt to open itself after you install it. The fist launch will take a while to open and begin running. If the editor doesnt open in 5 min, ask for help.

<br/>
4\. Once the Mu Editor launches, or you launch the editor, **set** the **mode to "Circuit Python."**
* if you accidentally picked another mode (i.e., NOT "Circuit Python"), you can reset the mode by clicking the "mode" icon on the top left of the Mu Editor.

<br/>
# Download and install library modules

<br/>
## Download CircuitPython library bundle

In this step, we'll download circuit python library bundle for version 7.x (i.e., "adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-7.x-mpy-2022XXXX.zip") into our computer

1\. **Open [https://circuitpython.org/libraries](https://circuitpython.org/libraries) link**

2\. **Scroll down** the site **to "Bundles" and "Bundles for Version 7.x"**

3\. **Download** CircuitPython 7.x (i.e., <span style="color:purple">purple</span> **"adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-7.x-mpy-2022XXXX.zip"**) 
* **Save** the file **in a secure and accessible location** in your computer. 
	
4\. Navigate to the location of the "CircuitPython-bundle-7.x.x" folder in your device
* *Notice*: 
	* Windows: if you are on a Windows device you'll need to **unzip** (i.e., "extract all") the **"CircuitPython-bubdle-7.x.x"** folder. If you are unfamiliar with "unziping" folder please ask for assistance. We are more than happy to help. 
	* Mac: Mac users, you don't need to unzip the folder, it's already done for you.

<br/>
## Install modules on board

In this step, we'll "install" two Modules from the CircuitPython Library Bundle (i.e., "adafruit_vcnl4040.mpy" and "neopixel.mpy") into our CIRCUITPY External Drive board. 
We'll do that by copying and pasting the two .mpy files from the adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-7.x-mpy-2022XXXX folder into the "lib" sub folder in the CIRCUITPY External Drive.

1\. **Open** the **"adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-7.x-mpy-2022XXXX" folder** in your file explorer 

2\. Once in the "adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-7.x-mpy-2022XXXX" folder navigate to the "lib" sub-folder within. In there, you'll find the two .mpy files (i.e., "adafruit_vcnl4040.mpy" and "neopixel.mpy")
* mpy files:
	* adafruit_vcnl4040.mpy
	* neopixel.mpy 

3\. **Copy and paste** the two .mpy files (i.e., **adafruit_vcnl4040.mpy and neopixel.mpy**) from the **lib sub-folder into** the board (i.e., **CIRCUITPY (D:)**) **lib sub-folder**
* These files are "modules" (i.e., set of prewritten python code) we will use in this workshop.
* This step is similar to "Copy CircuitPython to the board" Step

<br/>
## Connect a sensor

In this step, we'll **connect** a **sensor** (i.e., Adafruit VCNL 4040) with a **with the stemma QT cable** (i.e., JST SH 4-Pin Cable 50mm long) to our QT Py RP2040 board

1\. Take a stemma QT cable (i.e., JST SH 4-Pin Cable 50mm long) and connect to one end of the sensor (i.e., Adafruit VCNL 4040)
* *Notice*: The stemma QT cable only fits one direction.


2\. Connect the other end of the stemma QT cable to the board
* *Notice*: if **done successfully**, the **sensor's light turns on**

# Exercise:

At this point, you are ready to communicate with the board by loading/writing code scripts (i.e., instructions) into the editor and running/saving the editor
For this workshop we have preconstructed boiler plated code for you to copy and paste into the editor.
