# Set-up

## Setting up CircuitPython and the QT Py RP2040 board on your computer

1. Install the "Operating system" (i.e., CircuitPython) for the board (i.e., QT Py RP2040) into your computer

* **Open [https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_qtpy_rp2040/](https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_qtpy_rp2040/) link**
* **Download** latest stable release of CircuitPython **.UF2 file** (i.e., <span style="color:purple">**"purple"**</span> "DOWNLOAD .UF2 NOW") for the QT Py RP2040 
	* **Save** the file **in a secure and accessible location** in your computer. 
	* As of writing this document (i.e., Feb 10, 2022) the latest version is "adafruit-circuitpython-adafruit_qtpy_rp2040-en_US-7.1.1.uf2"
	* ALERT: DO NOT try to open the file.

2. Connect the board to your computer using a usb cable

* Connect the QT Py RP2040 board to your computer with a USB cable
* **Open [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/assets/101680) link**
	* In the link, you should see a diagram of the QT Py RP2040 board with a <span style="color:red">**red**</span> and <span style="color:blue">**blue**</span> square around two buttons. 
	* **remember** where the <span style="color:red">**"red"**</span> **button** is, also known as the boot button.
* With a usb adapter, for your computer, **connect** a **type-c** end **to** the **board**.
	* ALERT: *DO NOT* connect the board to your computer, yet
* **While holding onto the <span style="color:red">**red**</span> button**, located in the center, **connect** the other end of **the usb cable to your computer**.
	* Notice: once you connect the drive to your computer, your computer will recognize the board as an external drive (e.g, usb drive). Ignore the notification prompt. You can stop holding onto the red button now.
* If **done sucessfully**, you'll have a **notification** similar to connecting an **external drive** (e.g., usb drive). You can view the "drive" in your file explorer **named "RPI-RP2"**
	* Reminder: think of the board as the hardware (i.e., computer) and the .UF2 file as the "operating system" (e.g., Windows 10, OS X, etc.) necessary for the board to run.

3. Connect the "operating system" (i.e., .UF2 file) and the board (i.e., QT Py RP2040) 

* Open your file explorer and locate where the .UF2 file you downloaded in Step 1 is  
* Open your file explorer and locate where the external drive (i.e., board) you connected in Step 2 is
* **copy and paste** or *drag and drop* the "operating system" (i.e., **.UF2 file**) **into the external drive** 
	* *Notice:* if you need help finding where these two are ask someone for help
* if **done successfully**, the **external drive** is **renamed** to **"CIRCUITPY"**


## Downloading a Python code editor (i.e., [Mu editor](https://codewith.mu/en/about)) and [Circuit Python Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

1. Download the Mu Editor

* **Open [https://codewith.mu/en/download](https://codewith.mu/en/download) link**  
* Select your operating system (i.e., Windows or Mac OSX) and start to **download** the **Mu Editor** **in a secure and accessible location** in your computer
	* *Notice*: Ask for help if you cant download Mu Editor. A "Mu Editor isn't commonly downloaded" warning migth appear for some computers. You need to specify that you trust Mu Editor, "keep anyway," and to proceed downloading the editor.
* Navigate to the location of the Mu Editor in your File Explorer and proceed to **install** the **Mu Editor**, this might take a few minutes (e.g., ~5 min). If the editor doesnt open in 5 min, ask for help.
* Once the Mu Editor launches **set** the **mode to "Circuit Python."**
	* if you accidentally picked another mode (i.e., NOT "Circuit Python"), you can reset the mode by clicking the "mode" icon on the top left of the Mu Editor.
* At this point, you are ready to communicate with the board by loading/writing code scripts (i.e., instructions) into the editor and running/saving the editor
	* For this workshop we have preconstructed boiler plated code for you to copy and paste into the editor.


2. Download circuit python library bundle for version 7.x (i.e., "adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-7.x-mpy-2022XXXX.zip")

* **Open [https://circuitpython.org/libraries](https://circuitpython.org/libraries) link**
* Scroll down the site until you reach "Bundles" and "Bundles for Version 7.x"
* **Download** CircuitPython 7.x.x (i.e., <span style="color:purple">**"purple"**</span> **""adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-7.x-mpy-2022XXXX.zip"**) 
	* **Save** the file **in a secure and accessible location** in your computer. 
	* As of writing this document (i.e., Feb 10, 2022) the latest version is "adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-7.x-mpy-20220214.zip
* Navigate to the location of the "CircuitPython-bundle-7.x.x" and **unzip** (i.e., "extract all") the **"CircuitPython-bubdle-7.x.x"** folder
	* if you are unfamiliar with "unzping" folder please ask for assistance. We are more than happy to help.

3. "Installing" Modules from the CircuitPython Library Bundle into our CIRCUITPY External Drive board

* After you finish unziping/extracting there are 2 .mpy files (i.e., adafruit_vcnl4040.mpy and neopixel.mpy) we will copy and paste, or drag and drop into the board (i.e., CIRCUITPY external drive in your File Explorer)
	* These files are "modules" (i.e., set of prewritten python code) we will use in this workshop.
	* This step is similar to *Step 3. Connect the "operating system" (i.e., .UF2 file) and the board (i.e., QT Py RP2040)* from the "Setting up CircuitPython and the QT Py RP2040 board on your computer" section of these instructions
* **Open** the **"adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-7.x-mpy-2022XXXX" folder** in your file explorer and navigate to the "lib" folder within. In there, you'll find the two .mpy files (i.e., adafruit_vcnl4040.mpy and neopixel.mpy)
	* adafruit_vcnl4040.mpy file path location: C:\Users\...\circuit_python\adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-7.x-mpy-20220209\lib\adafruit_vcnl4040.mpy
	* neopixel.mpy file path location: C:\Users\...\circuit_python\adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-7.x-mpy-20220209\lib\neopixel.mpy
* **copy and paste** or *drag and drop* the modules (i.e., **adafruit_vcnl4040.mpy and neopixel.mpy**) **in** the **lib folder into** the board (i.e., **CIRCUITPY (D:)**)


## Connecting a sensor (i.e., Adafruit VCNL 4040) with a stemma QT cable (i.e., JST SH 4-Pin Cable 50mm long) to our QT Py RP2040 board

1. **Connect** the **sensor** (i.e., Adafruit VCNL 4040) **with the stemma QT cable** (i.e., JST SH 4-Pin Cable 50mm long)
* take a stemma QT cable and connect to one end of the sensor (i.e., Adafruit VCNL 4040)
	* The stemma QT cable only fits one direction.
* Connect the other end of the stemma QT cable to the board
	* if **done successfully**, the **sensor's light turns on**
