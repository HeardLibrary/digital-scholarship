# R programming basics: Tidy Data and basic data wrangling

In this lesson, we will examine the features of *tidy data* and consider how it differs from the way people often record data in spreadsheets. We will learn how to "tidy" a data frame and how to extract a subset of data from a tibble data frame. 

**Learning objectives** At the end of this lesson, the learner will be able to:
- describe the three features of *Tidy Data*.
- use the `pivot_longer()` function to transform a "wide" tibble to Tidy Data.
- use the `pivot_wider()` function to transform Tidy Data into the "wide" form.
- use the `filter()` function to subset rows from a tibble.
- use the `select()` function to subset columns from a tibble.
- use the `mutate()` function to create a new column in a tibble.
- use the `transmute()` function to create a new tibble from columns of another tibble.

# Tidy data and the tidyr package

For more examples and practice involving tidying data, see this Software Carpentries lesson:

## Options for recording data (4m32s)

*Experimental factors* are independent variables that the experimenter controls. *Measurements* are dependent variables that are responses to the experimental factors.

## What is Tidy Data? (4m14s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R0VC_502Hd8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

*Tidy Data* has three main features:

1. Each variable must have its own column.
2. Each observation must have its own row.
3. Each value must have its own cell.

## The pivot_longer() function (2m35s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aHECwUOFpUo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Use the `pivot_longer()` function to transform "wide" data into Tidy Data ("long" data).

The format of the `pivot_longer()` function is:

```
library("tidyr") # The tidyr library must be loaded if not already done

pivot_longer(wide_tibble_name, 
    cols = c("collapse_column1", "collapse_column2", "collapse_column3, etc.),
    names_to = "new_category_column", 
    values_to = "new_data_values_column")
```

Notice that you can make a function more readable by putting its arguments on separate lines and indenting.

Note: `pivot_longer()` replaces the older function `gather()`.

## Tidying and untidying data using R (5m30s)

Use the `pivot_wider()` function to transform Tidy Data ("long" data) into "wide" data.

The format of the `pivot_wider()` function is:

```
pivot_wider(long_tibble_name, 
    names_from = "category_column_to_become_column_headers", 
    values_from = "data_column_to_become_table_cells")
```

Note: `pivot_wider()` replaces the older function `spread()`.

# Subsetting a tibble using the dplyr package

## Subsetting rows using filter() (6m03s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oiBH_N7LCB8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Notice that unlike "regular" data frames, tibbles allow spaces in column names. When tibble column names include spaces, in code the column names must be enclosed in backtics (`` ` ``).

The general form of the `filter()` function is:

```
filter(tibble_name, boolean_condition)
```

Code examples:

```
library("dplyr") # The dplyr library must be loaded if not already done

filter(schools_tibble, `Zip Code` == 37212) # filter rows by a particular value
filter(schools_tibble, !is.na(`Grade 12`)) # filter rows by a more complex boolean condition
high_schools_data <- filter(schools_tibble, `School Level` == "High School") # assigning the result of a filter operation to a new tibble
```

----

## Subsetting columns using select() (4m05s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K0pnSiiW4Vk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The `select()` function has several general forms:

```
select(tibble_name, col1, col2, col3, ...) # select by list of columns
select(tibble_name, start_column:end_column) # select by a range of columns
select(tibble_name, boolean_condition) # select by boolean condition
```

Code examples:

```
library("dplyr") # The dplyr library must be loaded if not already done

select(schools_tibble, Male, Female)
select(schools_tibble, `School Year`:`Zip Code`)
select(schools_tibble, starts_with("Grade"))
```

----

## Creating new columns with mutate() and transmute() (4m12s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vtQZud_UXOA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The `mutate()` function creates a new column at the end of an existing tibble. The column can be the result of a calcuation. The general form is:

```
mutate(existing_tibble, new_column_name = calculation)
```

Example:

```
library("dplyr") # The dplyr library must be loaded if not already done

mutate(schools_tibble, total_students = Male + Female)
```

The `transmutate()` column creates a new tibble from existing columns or calculations based on existing columns. The general form is:

```
transmute(existing_tibble, list_of_existing_or_calculated_columns)
```

Example:

```
transmute(schools_tibble, `School Name`, total_students = Male + Female, `Economically Disadvantaged`)
```

**Note:** In the case of both `mutate()` and `transmute()`, simply issuing the command displays the output, but doesn't actually put it anywhere unless you assign it to an object using the `<-` assignment operator. That object can be the original data frame if you want to replace the old version with the new one. For example

```
mod_sch_tibble <- transmute(schools_tibble, `School Name`, total_students = Male + Female, `Economically Disadvantaged`)
```

would create a new tibble called `mod_sch_tibble` that holds the result of the modification.

```
schools_tibble <- mutate(schools_tibble, total_students = Male + Female)
```

would replace the original `schools_tibble` tibble with the new one having the added column on the end.
