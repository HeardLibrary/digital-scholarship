# GitHub for beginners: Recovering from disaster

In this lesson, you will see several ways to use the commit history of Git to recover from problems you encounter when working with files in a project.

**Learning objectives** At the end of this lesson, the learner will be able to:
- undo changes made to a file before it was added to a commit.
- revert commits to return to a previous committed version.
- resolve a version conflict between a locally edited file and a file on GitHub using Atom.
- remove and reclone a repository to reverse changes made since the last push to GitHub.

Total video time: 17 m 55 s

# Practice assignment

1. Edit and save a file without committing it. Then use GitHub Desktop to discard the changes.
2. Delete a previously committed file (but don't commit that change). Use GitHub Desktop to recover it by "discarding" the deletion. 
3. Make sure that all changes are committed. Then make some undesirable change to a file, commit that change, then revert that commit to restore the version to the previous commit. (Note: it does not matter whether you have pushed the commit to GitHub or not.)
4. Make sure that all changes that you want are committed and pushed to GitHub. Make any number of changes and commits, but don't push those commits to GitHub. Remove the repository using GitHub desktop. Then restore the older version of the repository (without the unpushed commits) by recloning it from GitHub.
5. Simulate a major disaster on your computer by just deleting an entire repository folder. In GitHub Desktop, try to switch to that repository. Can you figure out how to get it back?
