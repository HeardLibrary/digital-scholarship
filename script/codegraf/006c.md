Previous lesson: [Loops](../006b)

# Loops

In this lesson we will learn several ways to control the flow through statements in your code. We will use variations on `if` statements to do general conditional execution and use `try` ... `except` ... statements to trap errors. We will also examine how flags can be used to track conditions in the script and to assist in the decision-making process.

**Learning objectives** At the end of this lesson, the learner will be able to:
- compare the procedural and vectorized approaches to programming.
- use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control execution of code blocks in a script.
- explain how indentation affects the execution of code blocks.
- create names for variables to hold boolean values that indicate the state the variables describe.
- use a flag to determine whether a condition ever occurred during a loop, or whether a condition never occurred during a loop.
- use `try` and `except` to control the behavior of a script when errors occur in particular lines of code.

# Conditional execution

## if statements (9m 29s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12r7CQzshHw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Code example and notes:

```python
name = 'Fred Flintstone'
is_micky = name == 'Mickey Mouse'
print(name)
print(is_micky)

if is_micky:
    print('You are a Disney character')
print('That is all!')
```

Notes:
1. The double equals sign `==` is a comparison operator to test for equality.  When `name == 'Micky Mouse'` is evaluated, the resulting boolean value is assigned to the variable `is_micky`.  Other conditional operators are: `!=` (not equal), `>` (greater than), `<=` (less than or equal to), etc.
2. The `if` statement controls whether the code block following the colon is executed or not (don't forget the colon!).  If the value following the keyword `if` has a value of `True`, then the code block is executed.  If the value is `False`, the code block is not executed. 
3. As with code blocks in functions, the code block here is demarcated by indentation (of the standard four spaces).  In this example, there is only one line in the indented code block, but there could be many.
4. The `print 'That is all!'` statement is not included in the code block, so it will be executed regardless of the condition.

# Practice exercises

1\. Yale University has an awesome website known as "Is it chicken tenders day?".  The website is at <http://www.isitchickentendersday.com/> and you can read about it [here](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2011/09/08/is-it-chicken-tenders-day-question-answered-in-new-website/).  

Python has a module called `datetime` that includes various functions.  For example, you can get today's date like this:

```python
from datetime import date

now = date.today()
print(now)
```

There is also a *method* that determines the day of the week as a number (0=Monday, 1=Tuesday, etc.).  It's `date.today().weekday()`.  (More about methods next lesson.)

A. Modify the example above to print the day of the week number.

B. If chicken tenders are served in the cafeteria on Thursdays, write a program that will output `yes` if it's chicken tenders day and 'no' for any other day.

3\. Math

A. Have the user input two numbers. Set the value of a variable called `zero` to have a boolean value of `True` if they entered a `0` character for the second number and `False` if they didn't.  The section on [conditional execution](#conditional-execution) has a similar example.

B. Convert the two numbers to a floating point number using the `float()` function.  

C. Calculate the first number multiplied by the second number.

D. Calculate the first number divided by the second number.  Since dividing by zero generates an error, only do this calculation if the value of `zero` is not `True`.  You can do it like this:

```python
if not zero:
    (do something here)
```

The variable `zero` is being used here as a *flag*.  A flag is a way to keep track of the state of something in your script so that you can make a decision based on it at a later time.

6. Create a flag called `has_hyphen` and set its value to boolean `False` (That's `False` NOT in quotes.). Ask the user to enter a name string like `Huang Li` or `Lord Baden-Powell`. Use a `for` loop to iterate through all of the characters in the string. For each character,
