Previous lesson: [Loops](../006b)

# Loops

In this lesson we will learn several ways to control the flow through statements in your code. We will use variations on `if` statements to do general conditional execution and use `try` ... `except` ... statements to trap errors. We will also examine how flags can be used to track conditions in the script and to assist in the decision-making process.

**Learning objectives** At the end of this lesson, the learner will be able to:
- compare the procedural and vectorized approaches to programming.
- use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control execution of code blocks in a script.
- explain how indentation affects the execution of code blocks.
- create names for variables to hold boolean values that indicate the state the variables describe.
- use a flag to determine whether a condition ever occurred during a loop, or whether a condition never occurred during a loop.
- use `try` and `except` to control the behavior of a script when errors occur in particular lines of code.

# Conditional execution

## if statements (9m 29s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12r7CQzshHw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Code example and notes:

```python
name = 'Fred Flintstone'

# Evaluate the boolean value of is_micky based on the comparison of name and 'Mickey Mouse'
is_micky = name == 'Mickey Mouse'
print(name)
print(is_micky)

if is_micky:
    print('You are a Disney character')
print('That is all!')
```

Notes:
1. The double equals sign `==` is a comparison operator to test for equality.  When `name == 'Micky Mouse'` is evaluated, the resulting boolean value is assigned to the variable `is_micky`.  Other conditional operators are: `!=` (not equal), `>` (greater than), `<=` (less than or equal to), etc.
2. The `if` statement controls whether the code block following the colon is executed or not (don't forget the colon!).  If the value following the keyword `if` has a value of `True`, then the code block is executed.  If the value is `False`, the code block is not executed. 
3. As with code blocks in functions, the code block here is demarcated by indentation (of the standard four spaces).  In this example, there is only one line in the indented code block, but there could be many.
4. The `print 'That is all!'` statement is not included in the code block, so it will be executed regardless of the condition.

# Practice exercises

1. Yale University has an awesome website known as "Is it chicken tenders day?".  The website is at <http://www.isitchickentendersday.com/> and you can read about it [here](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2011/09/08/is-it-chicken-tenders-day-question-answered-in-new-website/).  Using the website, you can determine whether it is chicken tenders day (i.e. Thursday) in the Yale residential dining halls. The `date` module has a *method* that determines the day of the week as a number (0=Monday, 1=Tuesday, etc.).  It's `date.today().weekday()`. Import the `date` module. Begin your script by printing the question "Is it chicken tenders day?". Then use `if` and `else` to print `yes` if it's chicken tenders day and 'no' for any other day.

2. Create a list containing the names of the days of the week. Start with Monday and end with Sunday to match the numbering produced by the `.weekday()` method. Modify the program above adding a line to tell the user what the day of the week is today. You can use the output of the `.weekday()` method as the index number when referring to your list.

3. Have the user input two numbers. Set the value of a flag called `is_zero` to have a boolean value of `True` if they entered a `0` character for the second number and `False` if they didn't. Convert the two numbers to a floating point number using the `float()` function. Calculate the first number multiplied by the second number and report the answer to the user. Calculate the first number divided by the second number.  Since dividing by zero generates an error, only do this calculation if the value of `is_zero` is not `True`.  Note: you can test for the negative of a condition by saying `if not is_zero:`. Another alternative syntax is `if not(is_zero):`. Print the answer to the division only if it's not division by zero.

4. Write a second version of the previous script. Instead of using a flag, let the error occur and handle it using `try ... except ...` . Enclose the division calculation in a `try:` code block. Handle the division by zero case in the `except:` code block.

5. Create a flag called `has_dash` and set its value to boolean `False` (That's `False` NOT in quotes.). Ask the user to enter a name string like `Huang Li` or `Lord Baden-Powell`. Use a `for` loop to iterate through all of the characters in the string. For each character, check whether it is a dash or not. If a dash is discovered, change the value of the `has_dash` flag to true. At the end of the script, if the name includes a hyphen, print `That is a hyphenated name.`
