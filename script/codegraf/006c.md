6. In this exercise we are going to use a programming device called a *flag*. A flag is used to keep track of the state of some condition. In Python, it is convenient for a flag to contain a boolean and for the name of the flag to be some indication of the state that is being tracked. For example, if our script is monitoring the status of a door, we might use the variable name `door_open`, and assign it a value of `True` or `False`. Create a flag called `has_hyphen` and set its value to boolean `False` (That's `False` NOT in quotes.). Ask the user to enter a name string like `Huang Li` or `Lord Baden-Powell`. Use a `for` loop to iterate through all of the characters in the string. For each character,
