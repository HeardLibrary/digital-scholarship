# Conditional execution

In this lesson we will learn several ways to control the flow through statements in your code. We will use variations on `if` statements to do general conditional execution and use `try` ... `except` ... statements to trap errors. We will also examine how flags can be used to track conditions in the script and to assist in the decision-making process.

**Learning objectives** At the end of this lesson, the learner will be able to:
- compare the procedural and vectorized approaches to programming.
- use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control execution of code blocks in a script.
- explain how indentation affects the execution of code blocks.
- create names for variables to hold boolean values that indicate the state that the variables describe.
- use a flag to determine whether a condition ever occurred during a loop, or whether a condition never occurred during a loop.
- use `try` and `except` to control the behavior of a script when errors occur in particular lines of code.

# Conditional execution

## if statements (9m 29s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12r7CQzshHw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Code example and notes:

```python
name = 'Fred Flintstone'

# Evaluate the boolean value of is_micky based on the comparison of name and 'Mickey Mouse'
is_micky = name == 'Mickey Mouse'
print(name)
print(is_micky)

if is_micky:
    print('You are a Disney character')
print('That is all!')
```

Notes:
1. The double equals sign `==` is a comparison operator to test for equality.  When `name == 'Micky Mouse'` is evaluated, the resulting boolean value is assigned to the variable `is_micky`.  Other conditional operators are: `!=` (not equal), `>` (greater than), `<=` (less than or equal to), etc.
2. The `if` statement controls whether the code block following the colon is executed or not (don't forget the colon!).  If the value following the keyword `if` has a value of `True`, then the code block is executed.  If the value is `False`, the code block is not executed. 
3. As with code blocks in functions, the code block here is demarcated by indentation (of the standard four spaces).  In this example, there is only one line in the indented code block, but there could be many.
4. The `print 'That is all!'` statement is not included in the code block, so it will be executed regardless of the condition.

# Flags (9m 37s)

*Note to all English majors:* I should have said "None of your numbers **were** even." but I didn't want to redo the whole video!

Note: when writing boolean values in your code, make sure that you do not include them inside parentneses. `True` is a boolean literal. `'True'` is a string.

The % (modulo) operator gives the remainder after a division. Even numbers have no remainder when divided by 2. So `number % 2` will be zero for even numbers and one for odd numbers.

## Complex flag example (6m 11s)

When we use `range()`, we can specify the start and end of the range like this:

```
range(0, 4)
```

which will iterate through the numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3. If we omit the first number, a starting number of 0 is assumed, so

```
range(4)
```

will iterate through the same series of numbers as before. Recall that the end of the range is one number larger than the last number in the iteration. So if I want to iterate through a list with four items:

```
animals = ['cat', 'slug', 'bee', 'sponge']
```

by their indices, I would need to iterate through items 0, 1, 2, and 3. Therefore I could generate this sequence using `range(4)`. Since the number of items in the list (`len(animals)`) is 4, I can use 

```
range(len(animals))
```

to generate the range of indices for the list. This is a generalized solution for a list of any length, so it is better than hard-coding the number of items in the `range()` expression. If the number of items in the list changes or is not known in advance, this expression will always generate the indices of every list item.

# Practice exercises

1. Yale University has an awesome website known as "Is it chicken tenders day?".  The website is at <http://www.isitchickentendersday.com/> and you can read about it [here](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2011/09/08/is-it-chicken-tenders-day-question-answered-in-new-website/).  Using the website, you can determine whether it is chicken tenders day (i.e. Thursday) in the Yale residential dining halls. The `date` module has a *method* that determines the day of the week as a number (0=Monday, 1=Tuesday, etc.).  It's `date.today().weekday()`. Import the `date` module. Begin your script by printing the question "Is it chicken tenders day?". Then use `if` and `else` to print `yes` if it's chicken tenders day and`no` for any other day.

2. Create a list containing the names of the days of the week. Start with Monday and end with Sunday to match the numbering produced by the `.weekday()` method. Modify the program above by adding a line to tell the user what the day of the week is today. You can use the output of the `.weekday()` method as the index number when referring to your list.

3. Have the user input two numbers. Set the value of a flag called `is_zero` to have a boolean value of `True` if they entered a `0` character for the second number and `False` if they didn't. Convert the two numbers to a floating point number using the `float()` function. Calculate the first number multiplied by the second number and report the answer to the user. Calculate the first number divided by the second number.  Since dividing by zero generates an error, only print the result of this calculation if the value of `is_zero` is not `True`.  Note: you can test for the negative of a condition by saying `if not is_zero:`. Another alternative syntax is `if not(is_zero):`. Print the answer to the division only if it's not division by zero.

4. Write a second version of the previous script. Instead of using a flag, let the error occur and handle it using `try ... except ...` . Enclose the division calculation in a `try:` code block. Handle the division by zero case in the `except:` code block.

5. Create a flag called `has_dash` and set its value to boolean `False`. Ask the user to enter a name string like `Huang Li` or `Lord Baden-Powell`. Use a `for` loop to iterate through all of the characters in the string. For each character, check whether it is a dash or not. If a dash is discovered, change the value of the `has_dash` flag to true. At the end of the script, if the name includes a dash, print `That is a hyphenated name.`

6. In the error trapping examples, we have "gracefully" handled user input errors by printing some kind of message rather than letting the script crash. However, it would be better to let the user try again to enter correctly. The next several exercises will give you a chance to develop "bullet-proof" input code that gives the user a do-over if they make a mistake. **Part 1.** Use an input statement to let the user enter a number as a string. In a `try:` code block, convert the entered string to a floating point number using `float()`. Follow the conversion statement with a statement that prints the number. In the `except:` code block, print a warning to the user that they didn't enter a number. 

7. Important note: If you create an infinite loop in a cell of a Jupyter notebook, you can make it stop by clicking on the black square "stop" button at the top of the notebook. In a Colab notebook, a code cell that is running can be stopped by clicking again on the same button you used to start the cell running. While it is running, that button should have a "stop" square in the middle of it. **Part 2.** We can use a `while` loop to keep repeating code blocks until some condition changes from `True` to `False`. In this example, the code block to be repeated is the input code that you just wrote. It should be repeated an indefinite number of times until the user enters correctly. Set up the while loop by highlighting the code you've already written, then press `tab` to indent the whole block 4 spaces. The condition we will evaluate is the state of a flag variable named `try_again`. Since the while loop will only be executed when a condition is true, set the value of `try_again` to be `True` at the top of your code. Then just before the indented code block, insert the statement `while try_again:`. As the code stands now, the indented code block will be executed an infinite number of times because the flag `try_again` has no way to change from `True` to `False`. When the code block is finished, execution will return to the `while` statement and since `try_again` hasn't changed, the indented code will be executed again (and again, and again, ...). So we need to insert `try_again = False` somewhere in the code. Where can we put it so that the flag will be changed after we know that the input was correct? After you've figured out where to put the `try_again = False` statement, test your code. When you are convinced that it works, delete the statement that prints the number. At the top of your code, add an statement that imports `pi` from the `math` module. At the end of your code, calculate and print the circumference assuming that the entered number is a diameter. 

8. **Part 3.** The code we created in the last exercise is a bit rude because you must either correctly enter a number, or be forced to keep trying again and again until you get it right. A more "polite" script would give the user an option to quit without entering any number. Modify your code from the previous exercise by adding after the input statement an `if` statement that checks whether the user entered an empty string (`''`) by pressing the `Return` or `Enter` key without typing anything. Since the `if` statement is in the middle of a `while` loop, we have to break out of the loop. You can do that by issuing the single word statement `break`. Unfortunately, if you break out of the loop without entering anything, your statement printing the circumference of the circle won't make sense. So before the `break` statement, you could set another flag called something like `no_print` equal to `True`. (Of course, that would mean that at the start of the script you would need to set `no_print` equal to `False`.) Then at the end of the script, you can make the printing of the circumference conditional depending on whether `no_print` were `True` or not.
