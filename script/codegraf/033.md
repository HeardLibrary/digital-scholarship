# Controlling colors for geom_point (X-Y scatterplot)

## Setting fixed colors for a layer

Specifying color by name

```
ggplot(data = rel_data, mapping = aes(x = limited_proficiency, y = economically_disadvantaged)) +
  geom_point(color = "red")
```

Specifying color by [hex code](https://image-color-picker.com/hex-code-picker)

```
ggplot(data = rel_data, mapping = aes(x = limited_proficiency, y = economically_disadvantaged)) +
  geom_point(color = "#349c35")
```

## Setting colors based on a factor using a color aesthetic

Use the color attribute of the aesthetic to vary color based on a factor

```
ggplot(data = three_level, mapping = aes(x = limited_proficiency, y = economically_disadvantaged)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = as.factor(`School Level`)))
```

Setting and using a color palette for color vision deficiency

```
cbPalette <- c("#000000", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7", "#999999")
ggplot(data = three_level, mapping = aes(x = limited_proficiency, y = economically_disadvantaged)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = as.factor(`School Level`))) + # not required to convert to factor if character
  scale_colour_manual(values=cbPalette)
```

**Note:** Use `scale_fill_manual` instead of `scale_colour_manual` when using color as a fill instead of points.

## Setting colors based on a continuous variable using a color aesthetic

Use the color attribute of the aesthetic to vary color based on a continuous variable

```
ggplot(data = three_level, mapping = aes(x = limited_proficiency, y = economically_disadvantaged)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = percent_white)) +
  scale_colour_gradientn(colours=rainbow(4)) # the number controls the number of colors included
```

**Note:** Omitting `scale_colour_gradientn` will use the default color ramp.

# Controlling point markers

Code to generate a table showing all of the available point markers and their numeric codes (from [here](http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/shape))

```
d=data.frame(p=c(0:25,32:127))
ggplot() +
  scale_y_continuous(name="") +
  scale_x_continuous(name="") +
  scale_shape_identity() +
  geom_point(data=d, mapping=aes(x=p%%16, y=p%/%16, shape=p), size=5, fill="red") +
  geom_text(data=d, mapping=aes(x=p%%16, y=p%/%16+0.25, label=p), size=3)
```

## Setting fixed point characteristics

Use `shape`, `size`, `color`, and `fill` to control the appearance of the markers

```
ggplot(data = rel_data, mapping = aes(x = limited_proficiency, y = economically_disadvantaged)) +
  geom_point(shape = 24, size = 5, color = "blue", fill = "yellow")
```

## Using an aesthetic to set point characteristics

The size of a point marker can be controlled in an aesthetic by a continuous variable

```
ggplot(data = rel_data, mapping = aes(x = limited_proficiency, y = economically_disadvantaged)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = percent_white), shape = 2, color = "blue")
```

The shape of a point marker can only be controlled in an aesthetic by a categorical variable (factor)

```
ggplot(data = three_level, mapping = aes(x = limited_proficiency, y = economically_disadvantaged)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = `School Level`), size = 3, color = "blue")
```

# Filled plots

## Single variable plots

The outline (color) and interior (fill) of a bar can be manually specified by either name or hex code

```
ggplot(data = schools_data) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = Female), binwidth = 100, color = "red", fill = "gray")

ggplot(data = schools_data) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = Female), binwidth = 100, color = "#349c35", fill = "#9C349B")
```

The color of the category bars can be set in the aesthetic by setting the `fill` argument to the same column as is used for the `x` variable.

```
ggplot(data = three_level) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = `School Level`, fill = `School Level`), color = "black")
```

The default color scheme can be tweaked by modifying the luminance (amount of black) and chromo (saturation; intensity of color) using `scale_fill_hue`

```
ggplot(data = three_level) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = `School Level`, fill = `School Level`), color = "black") +
  scale_fill_hue(c = 80, l = 20)
```

**Note: Luminance (`l`) values vary from 0 to 100. Chroma (`c`) values vary starting at 0 and going up to an indefinite value (depends on the hue; could be around 400).

## Positioning in two-variable geom_bar (counts bar plot)

If one categorical variable is used for x, another variable can be used for sub-bars using  `fill` argument in the aesthetic.

```
ggplot(data = three_level) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = as.factor(`Zip Code`), fill = `School Level`))
```

Notice how this differs from the last example in which `x` and `fill` used the same column from the data frame.

The `position` argument can be used to change the way the sub-bars are stacked. A value of `fill` makes the total bars the same size and represents fractions, and a value of `dodge` places the sub-bars side-by-side

```
ggplot(data = three_level) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = as.factor(`Zip Code`), fill = `School Level`), position = "fill")

ggplot(data = three_level) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = as.factor(`Zip Code`), fill = `School Level`), position = "dodge")

```

## geom_col (numeric column plot)

In a `geom_col`, the aesthetic's has a `y` value that is a continuous variable. That makes the y-axis display that value rather than counts as in a `geom_bar`.

```
ggplot(data = co2) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = State, y= metric_tons, fill = sector))
```

As with `geom_bar`, the `position` argument controls placement of the sub-bars

```
ggplot(data = co2) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = State, y= metric_tons, fill = sector), position = "dodge")
```

## Controlling category order

The order of levels in a factor determines the order in which elements of the plot are displayed. The order can be changed manually using the `factor` function.

```
co2$sector <- factor(co2$sector, c("Transportation", "Electric.Power", "Industrial", "Residential", "Commercial"))
```

The first argument is the factor vector to be modified and the second argument is a vector of labels indicating the order they should appear in the reordered factor vector.

The order of levels can also be changed by sorting based on some characteristic of a variable as it applies to rows that have that level. This is done with the `reorder` function. In the following example, the mean CO<sub>2</sub> value for all the rows having a particular `state` level is used to order those state levels. 

```
co2$State <- reorder(co2$State, -co2$Total, mean)
```

In this example, `co2$Total` is preceeded by a minus sign to make the ordering descending. The final argument (`mean`) determines how the set of values applying to a level are processed to produce a single number that can be used for sorting.

For figures in papers that can't be in color, a grayscale color ramp can be used by adding a `scale_fill_grey` component to the plot.

```
ggplot(data = co2) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = State, y= metric_tons, fill = sector), position = "dodge", color = "black") +
  scale_fill_grey()
```

# Descriptive elements

## Legends, axis labels, and title

The position of the legend can be controlled using `theme(legend.position)`. Valid values are `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`, and `none`.

```
ggplot(data = co2) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = State, y= metric_tons, fill = sector), position = "dodge", color = "black") +
  theme(legend.position = "left")
```

The legend can also be positioned within the plot using a vector composed of the X and Y position within the plot (ranging between 0 and 1)

```
ggplot(data = co2) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = State, y= metric_tons, fill = sector), position = "dodge", color = "black") +
  theme(legend.position = c(.8, .8))
```

The `labs` object is used to set values of the X and Y axes, and title.

```
ggplot(data = co2) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = State, y= metric_tons, fill = sector), position = "dodge", color = "black") +
  labs(
    x = "states with the largest total",
    y = "CO<sub>2</sub> released (in 10^6 metric tons)",
    title = "Fig. 3. Annual fossil fuel combustion in 2018 (EPA 430-R-18-003)"
    )
```

## Examples of improving descriptive elements

The title of the legend is also changed using an argument of the `labs` function. The key of that argument is the aspect used in the aesthetic to visualize the variable described in the legend. For example, if a variable is used to vary the color of markers, `color` is used as the key for the argument:

```
ggplot(data = three_level, mapping = aes(x = limited_proficiency, y = economically_disadvantaged)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = as.factor(`School Level`))) + # not required to convert to factor if character
  labs(
    x = "percent limited English proficiency",
    y = "percent economically disadvantaged",
    color = "School level"
  )
```

If the axis labels are crowded together, they can be rotated using `guides`

```
ggplot(data = three_level) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = `Zip Code`, fill = `School Level`)) +
  guides(x = guide_axis(angle = 90)) +
  labs(
    y = "number of schools",
    title = "distribution of schools in Davidson County"
  )
```

# Exporting plots as image files

Like everything else in R, ggplot plots are objects that can be assigned to named objects (i.e. variables). Assigning a name to a plot object avoids an unwieldy amount of code in the export function.

```
grayscale_figure <- ggplot(data = co2) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = State, y= metric_tons, fill = sector), position = "dodge", color = "black") +
  scale_fill_grey()
```

The `ggtext` library is used to export plots as image files for use as figures in papers or diagrams in presentations. JPEG and PNG are supported natively. SVG images, which scale infinitely and are preferred by publishers, require installation of the `svglite` package.

```
ggsave("figure.png", plot=grayscale_figure, width = 20, height = 30, units = "cm")
ggsave("figure.svg", plot=grayscale_figure, width = 20, height = 30, units = "cm")
```

Note: ggsave apparently determines the export type based on the file extension used in the output file name.
