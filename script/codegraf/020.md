# Loading and saving files

If we load data into a script using an `input()` function, those data are *volatile* -- once the script executes, it's gone.  Unless we like re-entering information over and over, it's good to use other mechanisms that use information that persists between computing sessions. A great way to save your work and be able to access it again is to use a file.  In this lesson, we will focus on saving and loading text files (files whose bytes represent text characters).  These are files that you can open, view, edit, and save in a text editor.

## Unicode

In Python 3, all strings are composed of Unicode characters.  Unicode is a mapping between characters we would like to display and numbers that represent them. Unicode allows us to print characters outside of the Roman alphabet and typical characters commonly found on a US keyboard.  In earlier lessons, we saw that we could represent a Unicode character by writing the escape sequence `\u` (for Unicode), followed by the [four character hexidecimal number for that character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters).  For example, to write the character for the Euro symbol, use `\u20ac`.  We can insert the sequence for the escaped Unicode character in the middle of a string of ASCII characters. For example:

```
statement = "It costs $25.00, but that's \u20ac21.82 !"
print(statement)
```

## UTF-8 character encoding

*Character encoding* is the way that Unicode numbers are stored in a text file.  The most universally used character encoding for Unicode is called [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).  UTF-8 is a clever way to store over a million different characters and symbols using between one and four bytes.  It is also backwardly compatible with one of the early character encoding systems, [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII), which uses only a single byte to represent a character.  So all files whose characters are encoded in ASCII are also encoded in UTF-8.  UTF-8 has been around since 1993, but there are still some old files and applications that don't use it.  But you should always use UTF-8 as your character encoding whenever possible since it allows text in nearly any language to be represented.

# Text editors and code editors (2m13s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RIzK188oW2A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

When creating, editing, and saving the text files described in this lesson, you should NOT use a word processor like Microsoft Word. It will save files with a lot of information that tracks the format, font, color, etc. of the text and we don't want that. To create, edit, and save plain text files, use one of the text editors described below, or use a code editor if you have one. 

----

## TextEdit text editor for Mac (2m08s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L_PQ7PMByGk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

To launch the TextEdit program on a Mac, go to the Spotlight Search (magnifying glass in upper right corner of screen) and type `TextEdit`. When the name shows up in the entry box, press the `Enter/Return` key. In the file dialog box that opens, either navigate to the text file you want to open, or click the `New Document` button.

To use TextEdit as a plain text editor (no nasty hidden characters), go to the `TextEdit` menu at the upper left of your screen and select `Preferences`. On the `New Document` tab, select the `Plain text` radio button. Under options, uncheck everything. In the `Open and Save` tab, under `Plain Text File Encoding`, drop down `Unicode (UTF-8)` for both opening and saving files.

## Notepad text editor for Windows (0m58s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CFfyRemw394" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

To launch the Notepad program on a Windows computer, go to the search box (next to the `Start` button on the lower left) and start typing `Notepad`. When the name shows up in the list, press `Enter/Return`. 

Notepad should default to being a plain text editor. If you have problems with character encoding, when you open a file, pay attention to the `Encoding` dropdown. It should work properly if set to `Auto-Detect`, but if not, you can manually set it to `UTF-8`. Similarly, when using the `Save As` dialog, make sure that the `Encoding` dropdown is set on `UTF-8`.

## Code editors (optional; Windows or Mac, 2m13s)

To do the exercises in this lesson, you don't need to install a code editor. However, if you have one already, it's fine to use it. For example, if you installed the Anaconda distribution to get Jupyter Notebooks, you can install and run Visual Studio Code (VS Code) from the navigator screen. If you want to know more about code editors, you can watch the following video, although it is not necessary to do the lesson.

**Installing the editors**

To install Visual Studio Code, go to <https://code.visualstudio.com/>.  You browser should detect your operating systme and suggest the correct download for it.

To install Atom, go to <https://atom.io/>.  You browser should detect your operating systme and suggest the correct download for it.

# Loading files from your file system

If you are confused about navigating around in the file directories of your computer, or if you are unfamiliar with file paths, for more information see [this page for Windows](https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/computer/directories-windows/) or [this page for Mac](https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/computer/directories-mac/).

Of the next four videos, you should watch only the one(s) that are appropriate for the environment in with you are running Jupyter notebooks.  The examples illustrate using loading a Pandas DataFrame, but the process for accessing the files is the same for loading a data file into any Python data structure.
