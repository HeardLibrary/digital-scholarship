# GitHub for beginners: GitHub work cycle

In this lesson, you will go through a complete work cycle. You will control when things are staged, committed, and pushed to GitHub using the controls in GitHub Desktop. You will learn about the difference between raw and rendered views of documents. You will also see how versions have changed between commits by examining a diff.

**Learning objectives** At the end of this lesson, the learner will be able to:
- work through a complete work cycle editing one or more document.
- open a repository in Atom using the `Open the repository in your external editor` option in GitHub Desktop.
- explain why Excel is not the best way to edit CSV files.
- save a spreadsheet in CSV format into your repository directory using your spreadsheet software.
- use checkboxes in GitHub Desktop to control whether a file is staged to be included in a commit.
- execute more than one commit in GitHub Desktop without pushing them to GitHub.
- explain how the appearance differs between a raw and a rendered file.
- examine a diff (online or in Desktop) and interpret the changes that have occurred between commits.
- describe why GitHub is better for working with text based files (like CSV) than binary files (like Excel `.xlsx` format).
- add a file extension to the `.gitignore` file so that file type will not be suggested for staging.
- commit and push a PDF and view it using the online GitHub PDF viewer.

# Practice assignment

1. Using an external editor like Atom, create a Markdown document with informational content. Use several of the typical formatting features, such as level 1 and 2 headings, bold, and italics. Ideally, you would also try making something more interesting like a table or hyperlink. Save the document in your repository directory. Stage the Markdown document (check the blue checkbox) and commit the document.
2. Using a spreadsheet editor (Libre Office, Open Office, or Excel), create a small spreadsheet and save it to your repository directory and commit.
3. Push both of your documents to GitHub.
4. Make one or more edits to the two documents you just created and examine the diffs on GitHub Desktop before committing. Make additional edits and saves as necessary. When you are satisfied with the changes, commit and push to GitHub.
5. Go to GitHub desktop and find one of the documents. Examine the history and look at the side-by-side diff.
6. Create a PDF, either by exporting from a Google doc or by saving as PDF in Word. Save the PDF in your repository, commit and push to GitHub. Go to GitHub online and look at the PDF.
7. Delete the PDF from your local directory and push the change to GitHub. Go to GitHub oninle, find the deleted PDF in the repository's commit history, and download the deleted PDF to somewhere on your local drive. NOTE: if the file is not a binary file, the `Download` button will be a `Raw` button. In that case, if you want to download the deleted file, right click on the `Raw` button and select `Save Link As...` or something similar depending on your browser.
8. Complete you editing session by going to GitHub Desktop and checking the `Changes` tab to make sure that you don't have any edits that should be committed and pushed before you quit.
