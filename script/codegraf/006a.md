# Lists and dictionaries

In this lesson we introduce a more complex object: a *list*. A list is a named one-dimensional data structure that allows us to store any number of items and reference them by an *index*. The lesson describes several ways lists are created. It also introduces some ways to manipulate and edit lists. 

**Learning objectives** At the end of this lesson, the learner will:
- describe a list object.
- construct a list by specifying its members.
- refer to a list item by its index.
- create lists using functions and methods.
- extract part of a list by slicing.
- randomize or order (alphabetize) a list.
- randomly select an item from a list.
- modify, remove, or add a list item.

# Lists

## Introduction to lists (5m48s)

A list is a sequence of objects.  The objects may be the same or different, but often are the same.  The order of the list is important and items can be referenced by their position in the list, numbered from zero.  

A list is created by putting the sequence in square brackets, separated by commas.  In the following example, a list is assigned to a variable:

```python
basket = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'lemon', 'lime']
```

To reference a particular item, write the variable name followed by square brackets containing the index (position) of the object in the sequence: `basket[2]`.

To determine the count of items in a list, use the `len()` function.  In this example, it would be `len(basket)`, which would have a value of 5.

## Lists as output of functions (5m44s)

`listdir()` (list directory) function from `os` module.

```
from os import listdir

items_in_working_directory = listdir() # no argument for current working directory
print(items_in_working_directory)
```

`sample()` function from random module

[`random` module documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/random.html)

```
import random

population = int(input('How many items in hat? '))
n = int(input('How many items to draw from hat? '))
# sample without replacement
pull_from_hat = random.sample(range(population), n) # first argument is a range object, second is number of samples
print(pull_from_hat)
```

`.split()` string method

```
my_sentence = 'It was a dark and stormy night.'
words_list = my_sentence.split(' ')
print(words_list)
```

## Slicing a list (5m07s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mGnQCI6RcCk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

A *slice* of the list can be referenced using the following notation: `basket[1:4]`.  **Important note: in Python, when ranges are specified, for some reason, the last number in the range is one greater than the actual position in the range.**  So in this example, items 1 through 3 will be included. Since counting in Python is zero based, that means that the slice will contain the second through fourth items.

```
basket = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'lemon', 'lime']
a_slice = basket[1:4]
print(a_slice)

# Slicing from the beginning
print(basket[:4])

# Slicing to the end
print(basket[2:])

# Slice relative to the end
print(basket[-2:])
```

Retrieving parts of strings uses the same notation as lists.  (You can essentially think of a string as a list of characters.)  So to get a particular character:

```python
nobelPeacePrize = 'Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld'
print(nobelPeacePrize[2])
```

and to get part of a string, use a slice:

```python
nobelPeacePrize = 'Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld'
print(len(nobelPeacePrize))
print(nobelPeacePrize[12:15])
```

Notice that escaped characters count as a single character even if we write them as an escape sequence using several characters.

## Manipulating lists (4m15s)

**Randomize** a list. Use the `shuffle()` function from the `random` module.

Pass in the list to be randomized as the argument.

There is no return value.

```
import random as r

cards = ['Ac', '2c', 'Jc', 'Qc', 'Kc', 'Ah', '2h', '3h']
# Shuffle acts on the list object. It does not return a list.
r.shuffle(cards)
print(cards)
```

**Sort** a list. Use the `.sort()` list method. 

No argument is required.

There is no return value

```
day_list = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday']
# Sort acts on the list item. It does not return a list.
day_list.sort()
print(day_list)
```

Pick a **random item** from a list. Use the `choice()` function from the `random` module.

The list to pick from is passed in as an argument.

The return value is the selected list item.

```
day_list = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday']
# Choice returns a single item from a list
print(day_list)
picked_day = r.choice(day_list)
print(picked_day)
```

## Modifying a list (4m20s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d5CWyyg_vQ4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

To add an item to a list, use the `.append()` method.  Here is an example:

```python
basket.append('durian')
```

Notice that there is no assignment with this method -- you simply apply it and the list itself is changed. 

A list can also be empty.  You can create an empty list like this:

```python
hungry = []
```

You can then add items to the list using the `.append()` method. 

To change an item in a list, just assign a new value to that item:

```python
basket[1] = 'tangerine'
```

To remove an item from the list using its value, use the `.remove()` method:

```python
basket.remove('banana')
```

You can also delete an item using its index number:

```python
del basket[3]
```

Two lists can be combined using the `+` operator.

# Dictionaries

![diagram of a dictionary](dictionary.png)

## Introduction to dictionaries (6m51s)

<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DjOhhv6LHAI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Dictionaries are written as a series of key:value pairs, separated by commas, within curly brackets.

```
catalog = {'1008':'widget', '2149':'flange', '19x5':'smoke shifter', '992':'poiuyt'}
```

An empty dictionary can be created using curly brackets with nothing inside them

```
traits = {}
```

Both creating and changing a value in the dictionary are done by assigning a value by designated key

```
traits['height'] = 12
```

An item can be removed using the del command

```
del traits['eye color']
```
