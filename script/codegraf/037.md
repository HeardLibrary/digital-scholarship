# R viz using ggplot: Creating interactive ggplots using Shiny

Previously, we have made plots that are static. That is, once plotted they do not change and there is no way for the user to interact with them. In this lesson, we will combine ggplot with Shiny, the R-based system for creating web pages that allow you to interact with visualizations.

**Learning objectives** At the end of this lesson, the learner will be able to:

# What is Shiny?

Shiny is an R package that can be used to build web pages that are interactive (a web "app"). It's installed like any other R package. There are some conventions on how the parts of a shiny application are named and saved as files. If these conventions are followed, RStudio knows how to "run" the app. It will change the normal `Run` button to a `Run App` or `Reload App` button. When you run the app, a separate window will pop up.

This window is essentially a stripped down browser that is displaying a web page generated by a localhost server on your computer (if you are running RStudio locally). If you don't know what this means, but want to, see [this lesson](https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/computer/command-unix/#localhost-web-servers) for more information.

# Practice assignment

There are a number of built-in datasets included with the R installation that can be referenced without loading them from an external file. We will use some of them in the practice assignment.
