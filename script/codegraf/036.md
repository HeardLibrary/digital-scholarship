# R viz using ggplot: Controlling plot dimensions

In the plots of continuous data that we have created so far, we have used standard, linear X and Y axes. In this lesson, we will see how to change the number and types of axes. 

**Learning objectives** At the end of this lesson, the learner will be able to:

# Manipulating axes

We can change the scale or direction of either axis if it makes patterns in the data more apparent. We can also control the number of scale lines shown on the plot background.

## Reversing axes

## Changing to a log scale

# Polar axes

# Surface plots for three dimensions

In the previous sections, we've seen ways to visualize more complex data by eliminating or summarizing categorical variables. If we have a third variable that is continuous, we can visualize its relationship to two other continuous variables using *surface plots*.

ggplot does not really support true 3D plots. There are other non-ggplot plotting packages like `plot3D` that will generate actual 3D plots. However, ggplot can visualize a third dimension on a two-dimensional plot by visualizing the "surface" of the third dimension using contour lines or colors.

# Practice assignment

There are a number of built-in datasets included with the R installation that can be referenced without loading them from an external file. We will use some of them in the practice assignment.
