# Installing a programming environment

The purpose of this lesson is to help you decide on which programming environment is best for your situation. The first two sections discuss general issues related to program environment options. 

If you are learning R, your main option is RStudio. 

If you are learning Python, there are many options. The sections from the third onward show you what is required to use the various Python programming options so that you can reach a decision on the platform you want to use. After deciding, these videos can also guide you when you need to load a lesson notebook. 

If you are considering extensive work in learning about Data Science, you should watch the second video, which explains about the Anaconda distribution.

Once you have decided what systmen you want to use, you can follow the provided links to other pages with installation details.

Total video time: 33m 43s
