# XQuery Resources

Many of the linked resources on this page are from the [XQuery for Humanists workshop materials](https://github.com/CliffordAnderson/XQuery4Humanists) created by Clifford Anderson.  Individual linked pages are organized by topic below, but you can start at the [landing page](https://github.com/CliffordAnderson/XQuery4Humanists) to access them in the order they were presented at the workshop.

## Processor options and installation

There are several XQuery processor options.  [BaseX](http://basex.org/) is popular because it is open source and is relatively easy to install and run as a stand-alone application. [eXist](http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/homepage/index.html) is also open source but has a bigger learning curve because it is more complex and requires using a browser-based system to execute basic queries.  However, eXist also has powerful features for building web applications.  On can also run XQuery queries using the very full-featured [oXygen](https://www.oxygenxml.com/) XML editor.  However, oXygen is not open source and requires a paid subscription.  

Each of these processors will run queries that consist entirely of standard XQuery functions.  However, they also include special processor-specific functions that extend the functionality of XQuery, but that are non-standard and therefore will not work in other processors.

The [XQuery4Humanists site](https://github.com/CliffordAnderson/XQuery4Humanists/blob/master/README.md) provides some bare-bones instructions for getting started with the three XQuery processors listed above.  For more detailed instructions on installing BaseX, see the presentation below.
