# Scripting and Programming Languages

The resources here are intended to get you up and running on the scripting languages most commonly used in research.  If you need to learn serious coding, you may consider taking a computer science course online or here at Vanderbilt.

## XQuery

XQuery is a functional programming language that excells at processing XML.  It is a favorite tool for dealing with markup systems like the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and is often used in Digital Humanities projects.

## R

R is a freely-available, open-source programming language that is widely used for statistics and data visualization.  It is available for PC, Mac, and Linux.  Although R itself is a programming language, there are collections of pre-programmed functions, code, and data sets called packages that can be called on by users.  R can be run from the command line, but it is often used through an integrated development environment (IDE) called RStudio.  RStudio makes it easy to run R commands, create scripts, and check on the values of variables.
