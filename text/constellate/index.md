# Getting started with the Constellate platform

A short link to this page is [vanderbi.lt/constellate](http://vanderbi.lt/constellate)

To access the additional resources made possible through the Vanderbilt Libraries' subscription, you need to access the website either on campus or using single sign-on (SSO) through the libraries' proxy. [Learn more about the enhanced resources available from the subscription](https://constellate.org/docs/library-participation).

## Access

*If you are on campus, you should be able to simply go to <https://constellate.org> and skip the rest of this section.*

1\. Go to the Constellate record in the libraries' catalog by searching `Constellate` from the [library home page](https://library.vanderbilt.edu/) or directly through [this link](https://catalog.library.vanderbilt.edu/permalink/01VAN_INST/6ll2l/alma991043895203303276).

2\. Click on the `Constellate` link in the Full text availability section.

3\. Complete the SSO using your VUNet ID. You will then be connected to the Constellate website through Vanderbilt's proxy service. You should be able to see this in the URL.

4\. At this point, you can access the enhanced resources made possible by the subscription, but for best results, you should create a JSTOR account.

## Create account/login

Although it is possible to play around with the website without logging in, you need a log in if you want to fully access the resources of the site.

5\. Click on the `Log in` link in the upper right of the screen.

6\. If you already have a JSTOR account, you can just log in at this point. Otherwise, click on the `register one` link in the `Login with JSTOR credentials` popup.

7\. Fill out the information in the `Register for a free JSTOR account` popup, then click `Register`. 

8\. After you have completed the registration process, use your credentials to log in. Once you have logged in while accessing the website on campus or using the proxy, your credentials should be associated with the Vanderbilt subscription for 90 days. That will allow you to access the resources by going directly to <https://constellate.org> and logging in without using the proxy.

## Accessing a dataset

9\. Once you have logged in, you will see a link in the upper right that says `Your dashboard`. The dashboard is where you will access any datasets that you have created as well as pre-generated example datasets. Click on that link. 

10\. For your initial explorations, you can find one of the example datasets and click on Visualize to see what kind of information you can get directly using the graphical interface. 

11\. To create your own dataset, click on the Builder link in the upper right. If you go there after looking at a previous dataset, you will be refining that dataset, so to start afresh using all possible documents, click the `Clear Filters` button in the upper left. 

12\. The maximum size of dataset allowed when logged in as a subscriber is 50k documents. It takes a long time to build and use datasets of that size, so for experimentation, we recommend creating a smaller dataset of a few hundred documents (a 700 document dataset took about 5 minutes to build). Use the various Filters at the left side of the screen to create a dataset that includes documents relevant to the questions you'd like to ask. The graphical displays on the right will adjust dynamically as you apply filters. When you have selected the documents that you want, click the `Build` button in the upper right. Give your dataset a nickname and click `Confirm`. This should return you to the dashboard screen.

13\. The new dataset should appear in the `All datasets` section of the screen. It should indicate that the status of the dataset is `Building in progress`. When it has finished building, the status message will disappear and you can download or analyze the dataset. Note: large datasets can take many minutes or hours to build. If you leave the website, you can come back to check the status later by going to your dashboard.

## Next steps

You can use the Constellate Lab to analyze your dataset by clicking on the `Analyze` link in the dataset box. You can also download the metadata and n-grams generated when the dataset was created, using the `Download` link. For more information, click on the `Help` link in the upper right.

Constellate Lab uses Python and Jupyter notebooks to conduct analyses.
