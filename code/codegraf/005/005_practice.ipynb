Import the `cos()` function from the math module so that you don't have to specify the module name when you want to use the function. Since most people aren't familiar with radians, write a script that will allow a user to input an angle in degrees, convert the degrees to radians, then calculate the cosine of the input angle. Test your script with 45 degrees, whose cosine is 0.70710678118 ."

The easiest way to do that is to convert what the user entered into all lower case, then check for equivalence with an all lower-case string.

Determine how long it takes the user to enter something (or just press the `Enter`/`return` key) by finding the difference in time from before the input statement and after it. You can turn this into a reaction time tester by having one person click the run button and another person press the `Enter` key as soon as they see or hear the first person click the run icon. You can also see how long it takes Python to execute a code block by putting your two `time` assignment statements at the beginning and end of a code block."
