The website is at <http://www.isitchickentendersday.com/> and you can read about it [here](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2011/09/08/is-it-chicken-tenders-day-question-answered-in-new-website/).  Using the website, you can determine whether it is chicken tenders day (i.e. Thursday) in the Yale residential dining halls. The `date` object from the `datetime` module has a *method* that determines the day of the week as a number (0=Monday, 1=Tuesday, etc.).  It's `date.today().weekday()`. From the `datetime` module import the `date` object. Begin your script by printing the question \"Is it chicken tenders day?\". Then use `if` and `else` to print `yes` if it's chicken tenders day and`no` for any other day."
