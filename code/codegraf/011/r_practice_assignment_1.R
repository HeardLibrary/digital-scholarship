# Practice assignment 1.

# In the code that you write, for each object use a meaningful name in “snake case”.
# Write your code in the space after the comment prompt for each problem. Write any 
# verbal answers to the problems as comments following the prompt.

# Problem 1. Create a vector object containing the names of the days of the week.


# Problem 2. Create a sequence of the numbers for the days of the year (1=the first day, 
# 365=the last day). Assign that sequence of numbers to a vector object.


# Problem 3. Write the expression for Wednesday using your “day of the week” vector
# using an appropriate index number for the Wednesday item in the vector.


# Problem 4. Create a vector containing numbers from 0 to 100. Each number represents 
# the radius of a circle. Calculate the areas of those circles and assign the answer 
# to another vector. Note: There are very few “predefined” variables in R, but pi is 
# one of them. You can use pi in your code without defining its value. However, you 
# can also overwrite its value by assigning some other object the name pi. Additional 
# note: / is the operator for division, * is the operator for multiplication, 
# and ^ is the operator for exponentiation (i.e. r^2 is r squared).


# Problem 5. The number of dogs in five households is: 2, 0, 1, 0, 1. The number of 
# cats in the same five households is: 1, 0, 0, 2, 3. Assign the number of dogs to 
# one vector and the number of cats to another vector. Calculate the number of 
# pets (dogs plus cats) in the five households and assign the answer to another vector.


# Problem 6. Go to the example link from the Posit Cloud quickstart lesson: 
# https://github.com/HeardLibrary/digital-scholarship/blob/master/code/r/use_case_examples.R
# Load the script into a new R script the text editor pane. Run the three installation
# lines at the beginning of the script. This may take some time, so be patient. 
# Then step through the remaining lines of the script one at a time and see what happens.
# Explain what the difference is between 'install.packages("tidyverse")' and
# 'library(tidyverse)'. Why do you only need to do the first command once, but you 
# need to do the second command every time you restart the script?
