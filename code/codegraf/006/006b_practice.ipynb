In [a famous story](https://nrich.maths.org/2478), the young mathematician Karl Gauss’s teacher assigned him the task of adding all of the numbers from 1 to 100, with the intention of keeping him busy for a while. It didn’t work because in a few moments, Gauss calculated the answer, 5050, using some clever thinking. However, if Gauss were in school now, he could just write a Python script to do the calculation. Write a script using `range()` to add all the numbers from 1 up to any number that you choose. Note: if you use the `input()` function to get the person’s number, you’ll need to use the `int()` function to turn the entered string into an integer number."
