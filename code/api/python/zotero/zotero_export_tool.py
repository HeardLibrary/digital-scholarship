# -----------------------------------------
# Version 0.1.0 change notes:
# - This script does not currently support caching and conditional GET requests. If the dataset is large and changes
#   to it are small, this capability should be added. requests caching is enabled but that only caches HTTP requests for 5 minutes.
# - The script does not do any intrinsic throttling, since the API guide does not suggest any overall rate limits. However,
#   it does support Backoff and Retry-After headers from the server when it is overloaded or too many requests are made in a certain period of time.
# - The script does not handle every possible error condition, but if an agent ID is invalid (resulting in a 500 error), it 
#  does prompt the user to check the submitted ID.
