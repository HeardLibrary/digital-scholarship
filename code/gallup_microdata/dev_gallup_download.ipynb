    "The SFTP protocol doesn't have a way to stream file data; instead what it has is a way to request a block of data from a particular offset in an open file. The naive method of downloading a file would be to request the first block, write it to disk, then request the second block, and so forth. This is reliable, but very slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, Paramiko has a performance trick it uses: when you call .get() it immediately sends a request for every block in the file, and it remembers what offset they're supposed to be written to. Then as each response arrives, it makes sure it gets written to the correct offset on-disk. For more information, see the SFTPFile.prefetch() and SFTPFile.readv() methods in the Paramiko documentation. I suspect the book-keeping information it stores when downloading your 1GB file might be causing... something to run out of resources, generating your \"insufficient resources\" message.\n",

    "Rather than using .get(), if you just call .open() to get an SFTPFile instance, then call .read() on that object, or just hand it to the Python standard library function shutil.copyfileobj() to download the contents. That should avoid the Paramiko prefetch cache, and allow you to download the file even if it's not quite as fast.\n",
