# Understanding My Computer Bootcamp

Do you find yourself confused when installing software or trying to find files? Are you terrified with the prospect of using the command line? This bootcamp is designed for the person who wants to beef up their basic computer skills and feel comfortable with their computer's operating system.  

Each topic in this series includes parallel pages for Windows and Mac.  The Windows pages provide examples for Windows 10 and the Mac pages provide examples for macOS 10.14 (Mojave), although earlier versions will be similar.  Since Macs run on top of a Linux operating system, some of what is presented for Macs also applies to generic Linux.
