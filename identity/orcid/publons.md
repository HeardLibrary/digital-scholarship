# Synching Publons with ORCID

1\. Go to <https://publons.com/> and click `REGISTER` or `LOG IN` depending on whether you already have an account. Register if necessary.

If you already have an account, you can do a regular log in using your email address. However, if you are logged in to your ORCID account, you can also log in through ORCID.

2\. Once you are logged in, Click on the `Permissions` link in the left menu bar.

3\. You can set up synching in either direction. To allow Publons to pull records from ORCID, check the top box and click `SAVE CHANGES`. 

To allow Publons to push records to your ORCID profile, click the `GRANT PUBLONS PERMISSION...` button.

5\. Once you've granted access, there are more options. You can export existing publications by clicking the button. Check other boxes and click `SAVE CHANGES` to allow Publons to keep your publication and reviews lists updated on ORCID. 

You can also grant Publons permission to link your ResearcherID to your ORCID profile. This is a good idea since it connects these two common disambiguation mechanisms.
