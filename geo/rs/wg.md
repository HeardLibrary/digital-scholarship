## What's Remote Sensing?

Remote sensing is a way of collecting and analyzing data to get information about an object without the instrument used to collect the data being in direct contact with the object.  The 3 most common remote sensing methods is by airplane, satellite and drone.

Remote sensing is the art and science of making measurements of the earth using sensors on airplanes or satellites. These sensors collect data in the form of images and provide specialized capabilities for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing those images. Remote sensed imagery can be integrated within a GIS.

## About the group

Anyone who is interested in Remote Sensing, Geospatial Data, OpenSource software, or any other related topic is welcome to attend.  Please bring your laptop!  The format is for the first hour a hands on exercise and brief instruction followed with a second hour of "working with your own data" session.  Feel free to come to either session or both if you want.

## Venue

Our group meets on most Thursdays from 12:10 to 2:00 PM (again instruction is from 12:10-1:10 and the remainder is for help with your data) in the Training Room in the basement of the Eskind Biomedical Library (Room 010).
